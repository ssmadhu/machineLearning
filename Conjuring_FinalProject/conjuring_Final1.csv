Looks like a darker, meaner tone than the past too. They always really know how to put together and effective trailer for this universe. I\u2019m excited. What does everyone else think?"

2021-04-22T13:13:22Z, I think this will be interesting because real horror is being a good person and then doing an UNSPEAKABLE act to your loved ones, which is what I think this man did"

2021-04-22T13:15:48Z, The first one was great, the sequel was more fantasy than horror, and this doesn't look terrifying at all, and isn't even directed by James Wan so idk what to think about this, i wish they made something more psicological than loud jumpscares for the last one"

2021-04-22T13:23:49Z, Hello Warner Bros. I wanna email you and tell you about how you can get away with offensive media easily. It seems there have been lots of problems getting things age-appropriate or getting things to be not at all offensive. I personally want you to understand that the way you made your movies back then were not bad in any way. The way you should understand if something is wrong or unacceptable is by hearing the thoughts from the target audience that relates to it. This is a situation a lot of companies are dealing with and I want you to be the one to share it with more people because I think that these companies deserve to get away with much more stuff than wanted. It's easy not to get in trouble, all you have to do is find the right person to see it and if the target demographic is offended or horribly influenced, that's when you can know to stop. I wanna tell you this because you are my favorite company ever and the best way for you to avoid having to restrict so much is simple and easy. Just show something to the right person that either is targeted to watch or is the person you're scared could get offended and let them be the one to choose if the thing deserves to be removed, fixed, or unreleased. In conclusion, the thing I want you and other companies to understand is that as long as the target audience is not offended or horribly influenced, there is no reason for censoring. From one of your best fans: Jack Rodak"

2021-04-22T13:25:24Z,*Idk if it\u2019ll be good* but I appreciate they didn\u2019t do what your average franchise does and keep going with the same movies and milk the franchise dry
2021-04-22T13:25:26Z,I have been one of the few long lasting conjuring fans. ED AND LORRAINE ARE BACK!

2021-04-22T13:25:48Z, Hoping this returns to practical, subtle scares like in the first Conjuring. In that movie they brilliantly built up a sense of dread and terror. But this looks more like it will have the typical Hollywood jump scares like in Conjuring 2."

2021-04-22T13:26:38Z, Hope this one turns different from the 3rd and 4th installments of the film. Also, is this based on Amityville Horror case?"

2021-04-22T13:27:05Z,Hope this isn't the last one. This conjuring universe really is the equivalent of what marvel have been doing for over 10 years now. This is the horror equivalent. Will be watching this day one and I just hope we see this universe keep expanding.

2021-04-22T13:29:32Z,I'm a such a huge fan of the conjuring saga. But idk why ive seen this trailer it doesnt hit me so much. Myb bcoz of james wan not on this film.. i wish this movie succes just like the old one.
2021-04-22T13:29:36Z,Omggg
2021-04-22T13:29:36Z, As always, conjuring is the best #polisanam."
2021-04-22T13:29:37Z,The way a lot of scenes of this movie would also be made up just for thrill and scare like all the previous movies in the conjuring universe. I hate how the real life events of Ed and Lorraine Warren's cases are manipulated in these movies just for making it a hit \ud83d\ude15

2021-04-22T13:29:45Z, Man, I really thought they were gonna go with the werewolf case. I'm bummed, but I'll still watch this to see what happens. Also, does every horror trailer gotta use brightburns theme?"
2021-04-22T13:29:46Z,1:10 Every Horrormovie trailer ever...
2021-04-22T13:29:49Z,The Conjuring series would work so much better as a Netflix or HBO MAX original 8/10 episode show.

I really missed this badass couple. \n\nI wish James Wan was the director, but I  hope he has much more influence in this one. Especially since Conjuring movies are one of my favourite horror films.

2021-04-22T13:31:01Z,Since James Wan hasn't directed it this will be shitty no doubt. He is the reason for conjuring 1 and 2 success.
2021-04-22T13:31:06Z, The best in the universe are the straight up conjuring films, then it\u2019s got to be Annabelle: Creation! I literally can\u2019t wait for this movie ahhh! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25"

Although I gotta admit that I'm somewhat bummed that they didn't went the werewolf route that James Wan had commented about back when it was still being developed. Like, getting to see a actual werewolf horror movie, how could would that be?!. Nevertheless, this looks awesome"

2021-04-22T13:45:29Z, Idk. doesnt have the same creepy vibe. The reason the previous two were great was that they relied on a creeping tone, the eerie tension in the air, the slow gloomy build. This one looks a lot like other popcorn horrors with uninteresting side characters. \nMaybe because James Wan isn't doing this"
2021-04-22T13:45:35Z,01:50  it's Walter Bishop

2021-04-22T13:49:41Z,The conjuring 1 is the definitely one of the most horror movies that we have seen .. the series never fails to disappoint \u2764\ufe0f

2021-04-22T13:50:06Z,Can't wait to watch this. Conjuring 1-2 was awesome. Best thriller/horror films for sure. Also let's not forget that Warner posted this so... #restoretheSnyderverse \ud83d\ude09
2021-04-22T13:50:07Z,I'm a big fan of The Conjuring series (not the spinoffs) but I'm not feeling this one. The first two felt grounded and intense. This just looks like another generic horror film.
2021-04-22T13:50:09Z,James Wan back after aquaman and FF : lemme put that ghost into water and others will run faster.
2021-04-22T13:50:09Z,Who doesn't even have gits to watch trailer but will still watch the movie\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23

2021-04-22T14:04:27Z, That was pretty good trailer but i think the predecessors are still superior, its just too revealing to me. I hope this one will not disappoint me just like La Llorona which also has a pretty good trailer however the actual movie was a let down. Im still looking forward for this despite James Wan not directing this, I\u2019ll just keep my expectations low."
2021-04-22T14:04:27Z, So, the Conjuring Universe try to replicate X-Men First Class Universe by skipping from 1968 to 1974 to 1981."

2021-04-22T14:08:52Z,Is that Wiccan from wandavision?
2021-04-22T14:08:53Z,Haven't even seen one movie better horror than this universe.
2021-04-22T14:08:59Z,To be honest I love The Conjuring movies it's just that...I feel like it has lost the touch of James Wan's chilly scary creepy vibe for me. But we'll see how this movie goes.
2021-04-22T14:09:05Z,Did I just Fart?
2021-04-22T14:09:06Z,I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!
2021-04-22T14:09:09Z,From director The Curse of La Llorona 'Michael Chaves'.
2021-04-22T14:09:20Z,That's young Luke from The Haunting of Hill House! \ud83d\ude0d

2021-04-22T14:09:42Z,I love The Conjuring! It is one of the best horror franchises.
2021-04-22T14:09:52Z,Damn ! \ud83d\udd25
2021-04-22T14:10:14Z,Anyone noticed the last 10 seconds location.It is Twilight New moon location
2021-04-22T14:10:15Z,I will never look at waterbeds the same way again!!
2021-04-22T14:10:27Z,I do not claim this Energy
2021-04-22T14:10:30Z,This looks incredible but it gives me an uneasy feeling and scares me for another reason. That 'the devil made me do it' bullshit sets a bad precedent if the case was indeed real.
2021-04-22T14:10:38Z,Xciting
2021-04-22T14:10:39Z,These people the movies are based on are/were charlatans. Preying on ignorance and superstition.
2021-04-22T14:10:43Z,I think the villain here is more powerful than valak
2021-04-22T14:10:43Z,You guys are releasing it in the exam time.
2021-04-22T14:10:45Z,My most anticipated movie of the year\u2764\u2764
2021-04-22T14:10:52Z,$#@#$3@##!!!

2021-04-22T14:10:58Z,The 'Look what she made me do.' scene of the basement from The Conjuring 1 had a different level of Horror to it. That was James Wan as the director of the film and not just the producer.
2021-04-22T14:11:05Z,I'm so fucking excited to watch this masterpiece \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f

2021-04-22T14:11:18Z, This looks different, and might just be better! I hope..."
2021-04-22T14:11:39Z,Wowza...Looks like another hit for WB and the Conjuring Universe! So excited!
2021-04-22T14:11:41Z,Been waiting for a daaaammn long time!
2021-04-22T14:11:43Z, I love that they\u2019re not relying on creepy dolls, scary/cool demon design this just seems like a genuine ghost story"
2021-04-22T14:11:51Z,I hope this is as good as the trailer.
2021-04-22T14:11:58Z,Don't know why but after watching Lucifer i just can't accept this idea of devil..\ud83d\ude44
2021-04-22T14:12:00Z, looks like fun...but seems to be getting more and more \""Hollywoodish\"" with every release."
2021-04-22T14:12:01Z,THIS LOOKS SO GOOD \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd2f IM SO READY \ud83d\udc80\u2620\ufe0f

2021-04-22T14:12:36Z,I'm so excited to see Vera and Patrick again
2021-04-22T14:12:43Z, Wanna see it in big screen, I love Ed and Lorraine Warren. Patrick and Vera too. Well, I'd certainly did not expect it'd be so soon. Seemingly, delirious to watch this film with so many jumpscares lol. Jesus will salve us!"
2021-04-22T14:12:45Z, James Wan isn\u2019t directing so I\u2019m skeptical, but i still hope it\u2019s good!"
2021-04-22T14:12:54Z,I'm hiding behind the comments

2021-04-22T14:13:40Z,Felt like I\u2019ve been waiting for 20 years. One reason why I\u2019m gonna enjoy this summer. Now I must wait for Outer Banks 2\ud83d\ude0c.

2021-04-22T14:18:52Z,WE NEED JAMES WANN BACK
2021-04-22T14:18:56Z,2020 is enough to witness the existence of the devil
2021-04-22T14:19:01Z,James Wan is the magician of horror movies...
2021-04-22T14:19:09Z,yoooooo
2021-04-22T14:19:12Z,The Conjuring is the only movie franchise in which you know jumpscare is about to come but it still scares you

2021-04-22T14:19:23Z,I loved the way he said 'I think I hurt someone'
2021-04-22T14:19:24Z,This is gonna be  gass!!!  ftom  Agatha!!!
2021-04-22T14:19:28Z, My biggest issue with how this one looks compared to say the first one is the fact that it just looks like its gonna be the Conjuring 2 again, another cliche horror film. They first did everything right in every way, even the jumpscares were good, why can't they just stick with the original formula with the upcoming ones? I'd imagine its the change of director or whatever."
2021-04-22T14:19:29Z,Lmao
2021-04-22T14:19:33Z,Very scary
2021-04-22T14:19:37Z,Stop because I\u2019m so fucking exciteddddd
2021-04-22T14:19:42Z, In every conjuring movie \n\""Something terrible happened here\"""
2021-04-22T14:19:47Z, this story will be base yet again on the warren\u2019s other cases, clearly would be another fascinating film! \ud83c\udf7f"

2021-04-22T14:20:01Z, I look forward to the film music - something that often gets overlooked. Joseph Bishara's music in the previous Conjuring films has added so much tension and creepiness to the film. Props to the music department, including the musicians from the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra, and the London Philharmonic Orchestra for their unreal ability to sight read and record new music they've never seen before."
2021-04-22T14:20:12Z,Doesn't lean into the horror but maybe trying to keep the horror for the film instead of the trailers?
2021-04-22T14:20:22Z,Anyone who doesn\u2019t know \n\nThe young boy is Billy from Wandavision
2021-04-22T14:20:37Z,I just hope Michael Chavez didn't fuck up the movie.

2021-04-22T14:21:35Z, James Wan who directed the first two isn't returning to to direct this movie.. Instead they're having the guy who directed The Curse of la Llorona \""Michael Chaves\"" come and direct this movie... This worries me because The Curse of la Llorona wasn't the greatest. The Curse of la Llorona was filled with major plot holes and cheap jumps scares and that's my fear with what they're going to do with the 3rd conjuring.. I hope I'm wrong."

2021-04-22T14:22:19Z, 1:47 you can't do a horror movie about demonic possession and not have that iconic shot in your movie also I'm pretty sure the line \""The power of Christ compels you\"" will be in there somewhere ."

2021-04-22T14:22:41Z, I'm not feeling it this one, James Wan never makes it about the gore or jump scares. Only the atmosphere, tension and characters."
2021-04-22T14:22:42Z, Looks scary, but too much action.\nAwaiting \ud83d\ude33"

2021-04-22T14:22:55Z, REST IN PEACE?\nI have come to be peeved when, even devout Christians, say \u201cMay their soul rest in peace.\u201d This statement shows absolute ignorance of the content and teaching in the Bible, regardless of your denomination. First of all, no soul goes to \u201crest\u201d. They are either in heaven or hell until their soul is reunited with the resurrected body for judgement if you didn\u2019t know JESUS. Or we are awarded for our stewardship in addition to our blood  bought reservation for eternity in Heaven. \u201cRest in peace\u201d infers an eternity in oblivion or stasis where we \u201csleep\u201d forever. Even if you mean \u2018rest from work\u2019, that \u2018rest\u2019 is non sequitur because even though we will not sweat in Heaven, we will work for Him."
2021-04-22T14:22:55Z, this happened to me on 20th April 2018, but am fighting against the devil all time, and I will do not let demons win. \r\nIf anyone knows the way out, please help me."

2021-04-22T14:23:18Z,For some reason the title of this movie reminds me of Ice Cube\u2019s Gangsta Rap Made me do it.

2021-04-22T14:23:53Z,This whole trailer feels different. It feels there was no touch of James Wan here. But I hope they give justice to this.
2021-04-22T14:24:04Z,Is that the same cliff from castle rock?
2021-04-22T14:24:11Z,Looking forward to it. Love The Conjuring movies much better than your Slasher films. I'm an over 50 adult male and I still like a good horror movie.

2021-04-22T14:32:16Z, oh look, another compilation of bad jumpscares. nope"
2021-04-22T14:32:18Z,Look dumb
2021-04-22T14:32:20Z, The conjuring universe is just so phenomenal. It\u2019s a shame the nun was so bad, valak really had so so much potential as one of the most iconic horror figures. But it\u2019s good to see Ed and Lorraine back here as the main conjuring films are always brilliant."
2021-04-22T14:32:29Z,That cute little kid from Wandavision and Haunting of Hill House is getting so much work
2021-04-22T14:32:32Z,\u0e41\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e49\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22\u0e22 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e35\u0e4a\u0e14\u0e41\u0e15\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01\u0e01
2021-04-22T14:32:33Z,peed myself thx
2021-04-22T14:32:37Z, This actually looks quite good, I excited!!! just stop the spinoffs"
2021-04-22T14:32:39Z, Despite James Wan not directing this movie, I'm still very much looking forward to it as The Conjuring 2 is my favorite horror movie of all time and this trailer seems to really hype up my expectations!!"
2021-04-22T14:32:46Z,Unrelated but the most satisfying thing to me in horror movies is  when the skeptical person actually sees or experiences the ghost/evil...I mean the face they make is kinda satisfying\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02
2021-04-22T14:32:49Z,Is that subtitle real? Who wrote that?
2021-04-22T14:32:54Z, All the other movies in this cinematic universe have been going down hill, but Conjuring 2 was a MASTERPIECE! Conjuring 3 needs to be the best one yet! PLEASE"
2021-04-22T14:32:56Z,Best thing happening in 2021..fingers crossed..\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d

2021-04-22T14:34:18Z,Waiting for this\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd29
2021-04-22T14:34:31Z, Fair warning, guys: this movie is based on the true story of a man who killed his landlord and then claimed he did it due to a demoniac possession. So be aware that you might be watching a movie where they try to justify a murder and make the actual killer look as a victim."

2021-04-22T14:34:40Z,I am really confused to say 'can't wait to watch'\nIt's freakin scaryyyy!
2021-04-22T14:34:49Z,Another episode of *I can't sleep because I'm hearing some shit around me.*
2021-04-22T14:34:52Z,Wow we definitely need a horror movie now.
2021-04-22T14:34:54Z,Mind blowing
2021-04-22T14:34:54Z,The Conjuring \n       CSI
2021-04-22T14:34:57Z,The Conjuring Franchise  has some of the best horror films in modern day times.  There aren't many horror films out today that gives you the same fear as horror movies did back in the 70's and 80's.  I can't wait to watch on HBO Max.
2021-04-22T14:34:58Z,One word to say terrific ! \ud83d\udd25
2021-04-22T14:34:58Z,Ok I need Conjuring Universe's amitywhile movie coz I expected that when I read title \nNot saying this movie will be bad

2021-04-22T14:35:03Z,I don't feel any horror here it feel more like fantasy \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude42
2021-04-22T14:35:19Z,The story looks amazing.....Remember I heard it in every documentary related to the Warrens.....I wish James Wan would've directed this.
2021-04-22T14:35:21Z,Everytime I watch a trailer like this I'm afraid to go to the toilet at night afterwards lol
2021-04-22T14:35:26Z,Finally.
2021-04-22T14:35:33Z, Okayyy,let's watch this at 1am sitting alone in a dark room \ud83d\ude42"
2021-04-22T14:35:40Z,It gonna be more horrific.

2021-04-22T14:35:51Z,lets hope the 3rd one tops the first 2. i cant wait!
2021-04-22T14:36:06Z,Finally it's back\ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25
2021-04-22T14:36:10Z,1:47 reminded me of the iconic scene from the exorcist
2021-04-22T14:36:11Z,So is the bad guy suppose to be the one in the title
2021-04-22T14:36:21Z,Hoping this has some connection to the rest of the conjuring universive.
2021-04-22T14:36:21Z,The trailer made me shit my pants definitely not watching this
2021-04-22T14:36:22Z,is this based on the Amityville Horror?
2021-04-22T14:36:29Z,YES YES
2021-04-22T14:36:30Z,Really excited to watch this film\nWaiting!\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4
2021-04-22T14:36:40Z,The devil made me do it\n\nLil nas x; Objection my lord
2021-04-22T14:36:50Z, All these movies are so loosely based on true stories, that they shouldn\u2019t even use it to advertise."
2021-04-22T14:36:50Z,The Conjuring Universe is the best. And this one adds to that.
2021-04-22T14:36:50Z,Here comes another hit movie
2021-04-22T14:36:52Z, \""The court accepts the existence of God everytime a witness swears to tell the truth, I think it's about time we accept the existence of Devil.\"" \nThis really gave me goosebumps"
2021-04-22T14:36:54Z, I dont know, it just feel different from the other 2 just by not directed by sir james wan :v"
2021-04-22T14:36:58Z, This movie is going to suck. Mark my words. It has courtroom drama, legal and press thing, crazy jumpscares like the nun and a very generic overused plot. I was really excited for conjuring 3 but now I really don't expect anything from this movie\ud83d\ude2c"
2021-04-22T14:37:01Z,Conjuring has my hopes up
2021-04-22T14:37:04Z,Isnt this the killer that appeared in mindhunter? Where at the end he kinda admits that the whole devil thing was a farce and it was concocted by the couple to sell books or something
2021-04-22T14:37:05Z,It's more dramatic even when it is based on true story.
2021-04-22T14:37:10Z,They should have just stopped filming these
2021-04-22T14:37:12Z,Yikes....this doesn\u2019t look scary. Plus the real case has been proven fake as hell lol
2021-04-22T14:37:18Z, Normal Kids: Don't go there ghost will get you\nConjuring Movie kid: Heard creepy sound, he wakes up go alone and he screams.\n( Why? Why he going )"
2021-04-22T14:37:18Z,Early
2021-04-22T14:37:30Z,I'll try to watch it alone!!!\nNot boasting....i've seen THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE alone in darkness at night.\nI just love to feel th chills alone!!\nAnyone like me here??

2021-04-22T14:38:13Z, Movie looks cool, but I personally think the Warren\u2019s were fraudulent liars. How people of their (former) age can waste their lives with make-believe, nonsense, is beyond me. Because, science."

2021-04-22T15:09:33Z,This looks like every half-assed Netflix horror movie. The trailer has 3 jumpscares in it! I hope the final product is much better than this clich\u00e9-riddled trailer.
2021-04-22T15:09:40Z,YES YES YES CANT WAIT
2021-04-22T15:09:48Z, WB you idiots, why are you marketing a horror film as an action one? This doesn't feel like a Conjuring movie, this feels like a very grand action flick, which it's not apparently. And who the fuck cut the trailer! It's a poorly made trailer but it has the potential to be a good movie. I'm not paying for it though."

2021-04-22T15:11:44Z, Untreated mental health problems and myths lead people to believe in the supernatural without any evidence. Most common, Schizophrenia is the cause of people believing they are being haunted. The idea that its a ghost is more easy to accept than accepting you have a mental problem. That is why supernatural cases are mostly from small towns, Third world counties. Places where people are religious and believe in myths. Both the same thing.\nBig fan of the conjuring series tho. Can\u2019t wait to see this movie."

2021-04-22T15:18:19Z, I can already tell this will be the end of the franchise. Michael Chaves ruined the Curse of La Llorona (28% Rotten tomatoes, 41% metacritic, 5,3 Imdb) and judging from the trailer... If these are the most \""appealing\"" pieces to put on a trailer.... It's not gonna do any better. Which obviously sucks, cause the film series was amazing and the chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is legendary. It is going to be extremely hard to say goodbye to this franchise. Horror movies ain't about horror anymore, the genre has been transformed into political commentary and  drama. The Conjuring and Annabelle were the last true horror film series. RIP"
2021-04-22T15:18:19Z,Can't wait \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25
2021-04-22T15:18:47Z,The plot doesn\u2019t look as good or scary as the first 2..but I hope I\u2019m wrong. Still excited to watch it nonetheless!
2021-04-22T15:18:48Z, This looks much less scary than the previous films, disappointed \ud83d\ude14"
2021-04-22T15:18:49Z,I just wanna hear that twinkling sound of music box at the end of the movie once more :)

2021-04-22T15:20:39Z,Who came up with that name? It sounds like 2 different movies
2021-04-22T15:20:49Z,Hopefully it\u2019s more A24-ish and doesn\u2019t rely on cheap jump-scares and actually concentrates on disturbing stuff like they\u2019re saying.
2021-04-22T15:21:03Z,\u2764
2021-04-22T15:21:11Z, Please, don't let it be another clich\u00e9 jumpscare movie."
2021-04-22T15:21:12Z, \""The Devil made me do it\""\n\nMeanwhile, Lucifer: Eh?"
2021-04-22T15:21:13Z, All I saw from the thumbnail was little Harry and Voldemort creeping in, then I clicked it expecting the Conjuring collaborating with Harry Potter somehow, then realized it was never that so I'm disappointed, and that's why you shouldn't do drugs."

2021-04-22T16:13:41Z, Usually after watching a movie trailer or something else I really like going down to the comments section to find something insightful or that can add more details to the conversation, but nowadays most of it is the same stupid clich\u00e9 comments repeated over and over again in every other video. This is not intended to offend anyone in particular, but it's a  shame that we don't take full advantage of this powerful technology!"
2021-04-22T16:13:41Z,That  i dubbbz in the beginning?

2021-04-22T17:13:54Z,\u201cThe devil made me do it.\u201d Used that excuse on my mom as a kid and she didn\u2019t buy it
2021-04-22T17:14:09Z, One big problem I have with all of this \""devil\"" stuff... The Devil is a Christian construct. Christianity is not the \""one true religion\"". Hell, even the Bible isn't the original Bible. Look up the lost Gospels, especially the Gospel of Judas. It talks of multiple gods/angels, and Yeshua/Jesus states the God his apostles worship is not his father. That the creators of man were Sakkalas and Nebero. 2 of... I think 12 Angel-Gods? The story has been altered to fit a monotheistic religion when it is more henotheistic in that they chose 1 God out of a group to worship. The Jewish religion is also henotheistic as they chose Yahweh to worship out of a set of gods. \n\nThis isn't to say the paranormal aspects couldn't exist. I would frame \""demons\"" as more of a parasitic higher dimensional being. Also, not all \""demons\"" were considered to be bad, either. And following demonology, there are more things, theoretically, than just angels and demons. Satan would be considered as just another demon as there is an entire classification of entities called \""devils\"" separate from demons. \n\nMost of this is for sake of argument, mind you. Just saying the scope under Christianity is extremely limited in terms of understanding what possibly exists."
2021-04-22T17:15:17Z, Ever since I\u2019ve done psychedelics and understood more of the truth of how things work and knowing satanist run everything in the world, this movie just appears trash now; this isn\u2019t how ghosts or demons work at all"
2021-04-22T17:15:25Z, Damn, Devil really wanted to get out of hell since lil nas X moved down there"

2021-04-22T18:36:43Z,1:00 There is a frame In the trailer where it shows a  unknown face where Lorraine takes a picture but if you put the slow motion you will see it but you will have to time it right.
2021-04-22T18:37:31Z,I don't like the changing tone of the film. James does a great job with his color tones. But the new director has shown us that the film is more about action horror than spiritual horror. I don't like this one
2021-04-22T18:37:52Z,I\u2019m totally gonna see it. After seeing the nun 3 years ago I\u2019m finally gonna see the last chapter of the conjuring

2021-04-22T19:38:01Z, what made the first conjuring so great was that it actually had a sense of realism to it, more like a documentary. i feel like for the second film they swapped that feeling for more average jumpscare horror. which is fine, and i did think a couple sequences in this trailer were actually pretty good. until i see this one though nothing compares to the first one for me."

2021-04-22T19:50:17Z, I have lower expectations to this one because James Wan doesn't direct it, but Michael Chavez made \""the curse of La Llorona\"" which was a cute little horror movie, so I expect it to be nice.\nTrailer wasn't that scary, but I hope they save the scares to the movie, and I aslo liked the court drama in this, I hope it would have a big part in the movie.\nI am a sucker for horror movies with legal drama."

2021-04-22T20:36:59Z,A conjuring film will never be not welcomed. We fans have anyway collectively forgotten the nun.
2021-04-22T20:37:09Z, So when will we move on from jumpscares?  It isn't horror, it's just a startle.  After an endless tide of scenes that let the audio drop low only to max it out for a \""scare\"" I just feel exhausted of it all.  Yet people throw money at it every time so I have little hope for change, maybe that's the film industry's biggest fear..."

2021-04-22T23:12:23Z,Yessssss I was waiting for this love the conjuring universe
2021-04-22T23:12:49Z, Please read this carefully ;\n\nEvery one of us has sinned against God. We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .\n\nThe problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .\n\nFortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . \nRight before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..\n\nExcept gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; \n\nHumbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . \n\nDo these things, and you will be saved .\n\nIf you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  . \n\nYou\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true  .\n\nJesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;\n\n\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019."

2021-04-22T23:34:45Z, Gotta love the token skeptic they gotta paint as an idiot.\n\nYa know... not like they wouldn\u2019t want to study the phenomenon closer, bring in scientific experts, reproduce the events or find others like it to track and trace the appearance of these spook events, and learn how to reproduce it. \n\nThere\u2019d likely be an entire branch of the government dedicated to the study of the afterlife and potential military application of such things.\n\nLong story short; movie looks entertaining."

2021-04-23T03:40:08Z, John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen."

2021-04-23T07:06:25Z, I hope this is good because James Wan made the other 2 both of which are masterpieces, but this one is from a different director so it either as good as before or the start of the series downhill."

2021-04-23T07:12:52Z,And most of this is fake. Never happened for real. Total buzz kill if you ask me. Don\u2019t bother saying it\u2019s \u201cbased on true events or true story\u201d.  Just make the movie. Last good scary movie was insidious part 1 in my view.

2021-04-23T09:00:15Z,Am I the only one who feels like the conjuring just gets less scary with every new movie?
2021-04-23T09:00:21Z,Fact: Everyone was actually waiting for the next Conjuring Movie. Now the Wait is Over. I'm truly excited for this Movie.
2021-04-23T09:00:23Z, This one looks ehh. The other ones scared the Crap out of me. I remember the 1st time i watched one, was with my mom, we happened to be homeless at the time, staying in a garage at my sisters. Anyways, my sister came home from work, sat down to watch the rest with us, and then all the sudden, the light to the stairs turns on. All her kids in the basement are asleep and her BF is upstairs. So that scared the crap outta us that day. Im sure one of those kids happened to be up. Had to be. Im not one to believe in ghosts, but ive had witnessed some things that just cant be explained (like our Microwave, at night, it will randomly turn on. One night, went downstairs to get a Pop/Soda and it was on, nothing new so i turned it off. Thing is, as I opened to fridge to grab my Pop/Soda, the thing made the Beeps like you're pressing the buttons, and set itself to 3:50. That scared me. To hear it as if someone was pressing the buttons and turning it on. How do you explain that. Nothing ever sent chills down my spine like that night)"

2021-04-23T09:09:18Z,IS THIS REAL
2021-04-23T09:09:40Z,The first conjuring was acclaimed because it was very creepy and atmospheric. The second was cartoonish.
2021-04-23T09:09:57Z,Feminisin in this too dammit.
2021-04-23T09:10:18Z, It's not going to live up to the first two. Right off the bat, I knew this wasn't directed by James Wan. Shots are different, music score/sounds are different, and doesn't give that same atmosphere that made the first two."
2021-04-23T09:10:55Z,They give so much information in trailer thats why i will not enjoy this in hall\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f

2021-04-23T09:11:36Z,I could end up being wrong obviously but this looks super medicore compared to the other 2. It just seems like they\u2019re starting to run out of ideas.

I don't think anyone else could play better than them. Plus, Bonnie Aarons is in this movie too. Prepare for the Nun Jumpscares. And hey, is that kid from Wandavision. Julian Hilliard, right..."

2021-04-23T10:15:46Z, Yet another movie in the franchise that consistently ruins itself with cheap jump scares.   Every time I see one I'm immensely disappointed because there is an insane amount of talent involved, everything from the acting to the cinematography, but it all gets ruined by it's incessant need to startle the audience instead of actually making it scary."

2021-04-23T10:39:44Z, As a big fan of Conjuring 1, I really like the trailer also because its different from the first two films. And it really really hope that they will lead to what I expect cause this is a great story to tell, cause exorcism and curses can happen in real life especially if a person is weak mentally and spiritually. \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\n\nLove that Cliff scene awesome.

2021-04-23T10:53:47Z,The Warren's are just full of shit. And people who believes them are shittier.
2021-04-23T10:54:22Z,Another one!! Daam I thought they were done with those.. I don't know the first 2 movies were alright.. I think scary movies now a days are just noise music and somebody coming around the corner... Like its so repetitive in horror movies to where its a noise then music then something happens.. In my opinion when they continue movies like these with 1st movie and 2nd movie and 3rd movie they ruin them as they go.. Like fast and the furious it got dumb after 4... I just think they need to leave movies how they r and not continue becuz they might make it worse...
2021-04-23T10:54:30Z,\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02... Very scary movie \ud83d\ude02

2021-04-23T11:07:34Z,Conjuring 2 was fantastic. They show too much in this trailer though.
2021-04-23T11:08:02Z,Conjuring 1:- Devil change the rooms.\nConjuring 2:- Devil change weather.\nConjuring 3:- Devil change day to night.\nConjuring 4:- Devil change human to devil.\nConjuring 5:- Devil change earth to hell.\nConjuring 6:- Devil change himself to human.

2021-04-23T11:10:24Z,Somewhat I felt that the scares are repetitive and makes the trailer less interesting.... Feeling that the plot wont be that intriguing
2021-04-23T11:10:25Z,The Conjuring: The Devil Made me Do it\n\nThe Devil: Detective\ud83d\ude25
2021-04-23T11:10:56Z,Some people: I'm fearless\nThis video: Hold my beer
2021-04-23T11:11:07Z,If this movie was about Jesus Christ very few people would be interested. But since it's about the devil and evil Sign Us Up!

2021-04-23T11:13:22Z,god i really hope that this one will be better than the other films from the Conjuring universe. Most of them are pretty boring and just rely on jump scares.

2021-04-23T11:40:54Z,Is Flip Wilson in this movie?
2021-04-23T11:40:57Z,when will it release?
2021-04-23T11:41:27Z, I don't know, man. This trailer looks \""meh\"" to me, not convincing enough. Already have lowered my expectation ever since I knew James Wan is not the director for this sequel plus it's already the third film in the series. The bed scene was a nice touch though. What's up with loud generic music in trailers these days? Whatever happened to creative subtlety that optimize uncertainty thus creating genuine horror instead of cheap scares in trailers?"
2021-04-23T11:41:39Z,\u2764\ufe0f
2021-04-23T11:41:43Z,Can we *PLEASE* stop blaming witches for *everything* \ud83d\ude44
2021-04-23T11:42:08Z, For some reason, this doesn't seem like the last Conjuring to be made\nPS :- if it was starring Tom Cruise he would've definitely jumped off that cliff"
2021-04-23T11:42:13Z,Been waiting so long I\u2019m excited man \ud83d\ude2d
2021-04-23T11:42:20Z,Really disappointed with the trailer. Not a good one.

2021-04-23T11:42:46Z,I can\u2019t feel this movie like the other two but omg that looks scary still gonna watch it though.

2021-04-23T11:49:58Z,I don't know if this movie is going to portray exactly as the true case that happened \nIf it does then its going to be really good movie
2021-04-23T11:50:00Z, \""I've been possesed by an evil spirit\""\nThe evil spirit: ORAA!!"

2021-04-23T11:54:19Z, THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT\n\nThe Devil: Oh, oh come on, everyone blames the red guy. Of course. Well you know what? Sure. I did it. Because it's so obvious that I have time to take a break from ruling over my kingdom half-frozen in a lake of ice to go up to a place like Earth just to screw around with Random Family #212. You do realize humans are shitty enough without my help right? For every rapist and murderer and pedophile down here with me there's like a thousand more still living Earth I've never even heard of. You know what? Why don't you figure out this one yourselves and come together like rational animals instead of being all  \""HUR DEE HUR DA DEVIL\""? Does that sound good? No? Whatever. Y'all need to keep making movies, I see. Just remember that the Devil is at his most prominent where it doesn't seem like it. See you all in Hell."

2021-04-23T12:15:55Z,Looks toooo good! Im Wiccan so j believe in witchcraft not Christianity and i still think this is amazing
2021-04-23T12:15:57Z,I know i won't be able to watch the movie alone but the trailer is not scary at all\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05
2021-04-23T12:16:05Z, It looks really nice, but you don't need to show us the best parts to make us watch... come on, stop showing the best scenes in the trailer guys."
2021-04-23T12:16:13Z,Not sure how I feel about this one
2021-04-23T12:16:16Z,:devil made me do it\nDevil:i swear i was sleep
2021-04-23T12:16:17Z,I can't wait
2021-04-23T12:16:33Z,I watch these movies with half eyes closed lmao
2021-04-23T12:16:34Z,So this is what Wanda saw during the end credits scene. Interesting...
2021-04-23T12:17:16Z, To be honest, this feels a lot more like an action thriller. Part 1 and Part 2 delivered this sense of unease in the trailers but this is just a lot of screaming, flying, and running. Hopefully, it lives up to its predecessors."
2021-04-23T12:18:13Z,I want to see a scene where the nuns does something to the cross with Jesus on it I mean the big one and Jesus starts chasing the victims and kill them cause I had a dream of this

2021-04-23T13:01:33Z, Last SCENE IS MODIFIED COPY VERSION OF \""RING\"".\nJUST TRIED TO CHANGE SLIGHTLY."
2021-04-23T13:02:36Z, I actually love the quote of why do you swear to God to tell the truth in the court of law, but it\u2019s considered nonsense to blame the Devil for someone\u2019s actions. Last time I checked, although I\u2019m not religious, God and the Devil are both part of the same religious belief, so the actual thought of having to swear to God and that being widely accepted, but mentioning the Devil which is part of the same religious context as the other, is deemed unsupported and unbelievable...? Which really doesn\u2019t make sense...? Especially when in the real world case, the Warren\u2019s provided evidence of other worldly tampering in the case. Sure many can argue that he could have just been deranged, but who\u2019s to say people who believe heavily in God and say they have \u201cseen\u201d him aren\u2019t deranged themselves...?"

2021-04-23T13:06:54Z,Y'all Joking about the Devil til you realize they're base on real life. Lorraine Warren is a real person and has a collection of hunted items in her house.\n\nOther thoughts: I wonder how much holy water did they use to keep the real devil out.
2021-04-23T13:06:59Z,I can't wait for this film
2021-04-23T13:07:31Z,Watch this at 144p it will be less scary.

2021-04-23T13:17:54Z,To think that these are based on real true life stories from Ed and Lorraine
2021-04-23T13:18:02Z, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\nThe Devil: \u201cNow why am I in it, now see how I get thrown in stuff.\u201d"
2021-04-23T13:18:22Z, It looks pretty good, but I just don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll really be without James Wan directing it. Even just by watching the trailer, you can notice that it\u2019s not Wan\u2019s direction."

2021-04-23T13:20:51Z, This really is going to be the worst one. The director is terrible lol who even gives a shit at this point. First conjuring was dope, then they made stupid annabelle. conjuring 2 was kina cool, not as scary as the first one, but it had cooler cinematography, but also had worse acting. The series went to shit and I\u2019m not excited for this at all. Should have just hired a competent director. I\u2019m not saying this to be negative. I\u2019m saying this with honesty, I think this is gonna be the worst conjuring film out of the 3 100% but is still gonna be better than the other annabelle movies maybe or whatever spin-offs they made"
2021-04-23T13:20:54Z,This movie made me more excited for ED and Lorraine
2021-04-23T13:21:47Z,Is this just gonna be jump scares cause if so I'll stick to cod
2021-04-23T13:22:02Z, The conjuring is the best horror movie.1,2 and also 3.I know"

2021-04-23T13:26:01Z,I believe this is not going to be that scary \ud83d\ude10
2021-04-23T13:26:06Z,I read The Devil in Connecticut by Gerald Brittle back in the mid oughts. I assume this is based on that.
2021-04-23T13:26:15Z,That blatant exorcist reference lol.\n\nStill hoping we get a side movie on that werewolf in the mist though.

2021-04-23T13:28:34Z,It is good bit not that much horror
2021-04-23T13:29:01Z, These movies are always kinda nice but I just hate that even though it's based on a true story, creative direction always ends up making the rules of how a \""ghost haunts\"" confusing. Are they visible are they not? Why do sometimes they possess and kill people but then other times don't? \nAll questions here are rhetorical as it is just a movie, but I digress lol"
2021-04-23T13:29:03Z,Now i won't watch any conjuring movie because they r promoting satanism
2021-04-23T13:29:10Z,This better not be any other Hancock shit

2021-04-23T13:55:55Z, im pretty sure this is about world renowned Arne Cheyenne Johnson\n\nNovember 24, 1981, in Brookfield, Connecticut, Arne Cheyenne Johnson was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for the killing of his landlord, Alan Bono. According to testimony by the Glatzel family, 11-year-old David Glatzel had allegedly played host to the demon that forced Johnson to kill Bono."

2021-04-23T14:06:22Z, When watching modern horror trailers I'm usually more scared that they'll spoiler major plot points then of the things going on on screen.\n\nThis does look promising, however"

2021-04-23T14:11:56Z,Once you realize the supernatural isn\u2019t something real the movies become more enjoyable. Less scary but more enjoyable. Looking forward to seeing this addition to the series.
2021-04-23T14:12:31Z,Saya harap ini lebih menyeramkan dari conjuring 2. Sebab conjuring 2 adalah film horor terbaik selama ini.
2021-04-23T14:12:40Z,I enjoy this series for sure but new line could have a HUGE hit if they add Freddy and his demonic Demons possessing someone to do his bidding and the Warren's trying to stop this dream demon from killing more kids in Springwood

2021-04-23T14:43:12Z, It is directed by the guy who directed the Curse of LA Llorona, so it will probably not live up to the other two. It will be a flop."

And that is why he got possessed

2021-04-23T17:16:04Z, This doesn\u2019t look as good as the others but I\u2019ll definitely watch it. By the way, people making fun of the title \u201cThe devil made me do it\u201d is what the defense claimed after the murder. Arne Johnson killed a man while he was possessed by the devil, and in court he said those words. He was still convicted and went to prison for I think 20 years."

2021-04-23T17:30:58Z, The Conjuring and Insidious movies are only genuine horror movies with devils and ghosts. Most of horror nowadays are full of bloody murder scenes and showing nasty scenes. We want to be scare, not to feel gross."
2021-04-23T17:31:10Z,Well looks like it time for me to shit myself again from the jump scares and cry from laughter of people getting thrown across the map.

2021-04-23T17:34:01Z,Americans just suck at making horror films
2021-04-23T17:34:05Z,The question is is this part based on a true story\ud83d\ude2c

2021-04-23T17:40:10Z,Trailer for this is garbage and shows you just about everything (wish they'd stop doing that) and overall looks a bit meh. Was looking forward to this too.

2021-04-23T18:21:52Z, i really enjoyed the conjuring movies at first, but ever since other directors took over and started replacing james wan, the movies weren't as great as the first few that james directed. Michael Chaves directed this one, and i dont know how good its going to be, because The Curse of La Llorona wasnt that great."

2021-04-23T18:26:21Z,So after the hex closed billy went to this universe
2021-04-23T18:26:29Z, Woah! You still haven't learned to make a proper trailer without showing everything that happens in the movie. Ex, that scene when Lorraine gets to the cliff and Ed calls her, you could have cut that there instead of showing already that a spirit/demon whatever grabs her leg and pulls her down. Things like that totally ruin the movie for me when watching it for the 1st time."
2021-04-23T18:27:08Z,Why don't they make cameo appearance for old ghosts in such movies... like put some red balloons in a corner and wait for audience to find out
2021-04-23T18:27:09Z,One of my fav horror movies Conjuring its his best!!

2021-04-23T18:33:25Z,- The Conjuring : in theaters June 4\n- Coronavirus : that's cute
2021-04-23T18:33:33Z,This shit is getting lame
2021-04-23T18:33:42Z, Please read this carefully ;\n\nEvery one of us has sinned against God. We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .\n\nThe problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .\n\nFortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . \nRight before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..\n\nExcept gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; \n\nHumbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . \n\nDo these things, and you will be saved .\n\nIf you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  . \n\nYou\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true  .\n\nJesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;\n\n\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019  ."

2021-04-23T20:14:11Z,This storyline is the tired and overused to a cringey lvl

2021-04-23T20:22:52Z, Many souls have been led astray. \nWith this I leave you,\nHe or she who seeks good will ultimately have to go through what is opposite but equal\nBe cognizant of these naturally-born evils"
2021-04-23T20:23:03Z,As an atheist I love watching this kind of movie and see real religious people get freaked out by it \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd23
2021-04-23T20:23:49Z, I so wish horror films based on \""true stories\"" weren't so overdramatic and overdone. Thus leaving them feeling no where close to the actual story. This doesn't look scary at all to me. More loud noises and jump scares. Awesome. \ud83e\udd71"
2021-04-23T20:24:35Z,This is coming out on my birthday omg \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d

2021-04-23T20:26:57Z,I like these movies but I wish they would stop referring to it as based on true case files. These guys were total con artists in real life.

2021-04-23T21:25:34Z,Yesss. Finally!
2021-04-23T21:26:27Z,The Conjuring  movies are scary and I love them. I still can't  beleive  critics  say Sinister is the scariest movie of all time. What a slap in the face.
2021-04-23T21:28:47Z,Ain't nothin to it\nGangsta rap made me do it
2021-04-23T21:28:51Z, Dude, where's the Nun? \ud83d\ude12"
2021-04-23T21:30:43Z,Yet there was no take on their most famous case the amittyville. They gotta that happen and not end it here.
2021-04-23T21:31:51Z,Seems like a boring misstep in the franchaise. I hope I'm wrong but a court room drama sounds as dull as anything.

2021-04-23T21:35:56Z,Wait. Am I a sociopath? Because this was not scary at all for me. Hollywood jump scares are tired.

2021-04-23T23:14:25Z,Enjoyed the first one. But these Hollywood \u201cAAA\u201d horror movies ain\u2019t doing it for me anymore. These suits need to go back and watch The Exorcist and some of the A24 catalogue and take notes. Shoot horror films as THRILLERS instead of horror films. Not difficult.

2021-04-23T23:45:10Z, I have to be honest, as much as I love The Conjuring series, this trailer doesn\u2019t look promising. But, it\u2019s just a trailer, and I\u2019ll probably watch it anyways."

But The Conjuring movies (and insidious) are movies that we can HONESTLY say get us! And idc what a lot of people said about the second conjuring (my boyfriend included lol) but I don\u2019t think it was bad at all.. and, having seen it in theaters which def made it and bit creepier -being on a huge screen and loud etc etc - it was the first movie, and the last movie, since the first one that actually made me jump! And I mean.. that\u2019s all it really takes sometimes to make a horror movie a good one! Lol SOO.. to everyone who says it sucked but were definitely jumping a bit throughout it.. YOU LIAARS!"

2021-04-24T04:29:01Z, In the thumbnail, the demon looks like Voldemort \ud83d\ude02"
2021-04-24T04:29:15Z, Either this is a bad transition time for CGI or COVID has really affected post production quality because all of these \""skip theater, straight to streaming blockbusters\"" have had terrible CGI, especially when it comes to background rendering and green screen. I mean it was abysmal in the new Mortal Kombat and it is apparent in this trailer during the cliff scene. I guarantee it would have looked more polished had COVID not happened during most of these movies post-production. I mean luckily Mortal Kombat was bad enough on it's own in a cheesy way that it almost felt nostalgic and \""so-bad-it's-good\"" sort of way. I still have high hopes for this one despite the James Wan departure. Even with Insidious, despite the numerous directors and the distinct lack of quality James Wan produced, none of them were terrible and at least entertaining enough the first watch. Anyways I digress...excited for the movie, disappointed in the clear disregard for CGI, unless as I said earlier, we are going through a transition period, similar to when CGI first came around and it looked like video game graphics of the PS1 era."
2021-04-24T04:29:16Z,This looks good but nothing beating the original
2021-04-24T04:31:32Z,In theaters!!! Really to join them to experience live show after life???

2021-04-24T08:22:45Z, A little history about this movie :\nShooting was finished in September - December of 2019 . It was pushed back from September 2020 to June 2021 . But those who have seen it from the screenings they said many positive things . But they all pointed out a negative part of the movie . It had too violent/gross/explicit scenes such as blood vomit,violent deaths etc . So they rewrote those scenes and reshoot them and they finished shooting in March 2021"

2021-04-24T12:08:05Z, For those who asking about the spam of \""Twerking\"" Its a ruse to freeze views. Spam commenting messes something with youtube so the view count freezes because the system thinks its bot activity. It mostly comes from haters who mass comment to mess with the views so the videos get less view count. Happens all the time with Blackpink and Trailers for movies... Basically, they are people who have nothing to do in life or have caught the new strain of Covid-19 that affects neurons... That is why producers should put an age restriction on minors.  People today are very frustrated with themselves and life ..."

2021-04-24T15:31:32Z, Top 10 of the World's Funniest One Liners\n\n1. Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular?\n2. Save the whales. Collect the whole set. \n3. A day without sunshine is like, night.\n4. If ignorance is bliss, then tourists are in a constant state of euphoria.\n5. If at first you don't succeed, don't try skydiving.\n6. According to my best recollection, I don't remember.\n7. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. \n8. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep. \n9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.\n10. Why is \""abbreviation\"" such a long word?\n\n\n    Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is \""Eat \nright. Stay fit. Die anyway.\"" It's sad but true -- no matter what you \ndo, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see\n if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)?\n Jesus said, \""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has \ncommitted adultery already with her in his heart.\"" Ever looked with \nlust? If you have said \""Yes\"" to these three questions, by your own \nadmission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only\n looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment \nDay? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, \nand end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to \nbe forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: \""God commended His\n love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for \nus.\"" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises \neverlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and \ntrust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have \ntomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible \ndaily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit \nNeedGod.com."

2021-04-24T18:16:29Z, Hello, to all :D . I am interrupting, this comment, feed, to inform you guys, that, you need to go to, Church. You need to, formally, accept your, new, Religion. Reminder: At present, everyone, has a new, Religion. All Human Beings, no longer, worship, the, American, Hollywood, version, of, God. They, no longer, worship, the American Hollywood, version, of, Religion. So, you have to, physically, go to, your, new, Church. If you are not in an area, where you have access, to your new, and current, Religion- then you can worship, on your own, with others! Also, If you are in an area, where the, Global Pandemic, is underway, then, find a church service, online. When you are spiritually clean, and normal, you are able to feel, comfortable; all the time. You feel safe, confident, happy, healthy, and whole, with yourself, with your God(s), and within the entirety, of your, Religion. You are able to be a, loving family, and community, when you are in a good place, spiritually. All of you, in this comment feed, and all of you, who participated, in the, Paris Hilton-Britney Spears- Donald Trump-Make America Great Again- Joe Biden-Kardashian-iPhone-Emoji, sin based, hell bound, nonsense, \""society,\"" definitely, need to get, spiritually clean, within the formal body, of your, Religion. Hello, it\u2019s, ME!, Brittney Lee Hill Collier. My Destiny, is to be, a famous, British actress, and a Royal, for the, United Kingdom. To date, I figured out that, Henry Cavill (he is the famous, British actor, who plays, Superman. He played, Superman, in, \u201cMan of Steel,\u201d which came out in the year, 2013), Tom Ellis (he is the famous, British actor, who plays, Lucifer, on the American, television show, \u201cLucifer.\u201d), Russell Brand (he is the famous, Comedian, and British actor, who married, Katy Perry), Johnathan Rhys Meyers (he is the famous, Swedish actor, famous for starring, on the show, \u201cThe Tudors.\u201d He is also, very famous, for starring, in the movie, \u201cMatch Point.\u201d), and Louis Garrel (he is the famous, French actor, exalted, for starring, in the movie, \u201cMa Mere.\u201d He is also, very famous, for starring, in the movie, \u201cThe Dreamers.\u201d), are supposed to be my, Husbands. That means, all 6 of us, have it in our, Destiny, to be the, Kings, and Queen, of the, United Kingdom. Gosh, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out, which famous, White actor, was my Husband (or, Husbands), since the year, 2011, or so. :D HAHAHA! So now, I\u2019ll be traveling, back, to the, United Kingdom, from Fullerton, C.A. (Fullerton, C.A., is in the, Country, of, the United States, within the, County, of, Orang n e.). I went to the, United Kingdom, in 2020, during the, current, Global Pandemic. FACT. I\u2019ve known the, Global Pandemic, was fake, since, it began. FACT. Now that I know who my, Husbands, are, I just have to wait, a month, exactly, and then I can travel, back, to the, United Kingdom, for the final time, to meet, and marry them. I will be, meeting them, in the city of, Essex. YAY, for me :D ! I have, 5, Hot Husbands. I\u2019m so excited! They are, super sexy: beautiful, fun, wild party guys, intense, confident, cocky, and genius, Celebrity. I am lucky. I know (already), that they will, value, Monarchy, and Tradition, just as much as, I do, by the time I finally meet them in person. They better <3! Laugh out Loud. They\u2019re my dream, Men. Tom Ellis, has 3 daughters, they are named, Florence, Nora, and Marnie. So, they are my, daughters! I have 3, daughters, already, how wonderful, to know! They have been making me so, proud :D . I made them this way. Their ages range, from 7 to 19. I, HATE, their current, Stepmom, Meghan Oppenheimer. She is, not, good for them. She has been, a bad person, and ugly, inside, and out, her whole, life. She is a, Nerd. She is, young, in her, 30\u2019s, like me, and a, Classic Nerd. She is a, gawker (Defined: to stare, stupidly; gape. An awkward, foolish, person. peer, ogle, gaze, goggle, rubberneck). She stares, too hard. I am, Cool. I have always, been, popular, super social, well loved, and loving- outgoing, and a, crazy, truly wild, party girl. I am, a, Hippie. The type of Hippie, I am, is, Raver. I am a, Raver. We partied, hard, in my 20\u2019s! We still party, hard, in various places. It\u2019s, awesome! We are awesome! HAHAHAHA! I, AM, WHITE. I am, a, Traditional, White American, Female- from the, Deep South. My skin, is, light brown, so you can tell, that I am, a part, of the, Black, African American, community. However, I, AM, WHITE. WHITE, people, are, My people. They are my people. I am, White. That means, I am, NOT, a, Negro. I am not a, Negro. So, do not, pretend, that I am, Black, or a, Negro; Ever. If you do, you will not survive, this life. My story, is very interesting, so far, isn\u2019t it? And, I still, haven\u2019t even gotten out into the world! I haven\u2019t even met, my Husbands, yet? What the heck, World? Beginning, in the year, 2000, Human Society, itself, has been, disobedient, disoriented- in disarray, and purposeless. That is why, I have not been, able, to live out my, Human Destiny. I, AM, happy- that I have the money, and the ability- as a, Middle class, American citizen. WITH FATHER GOD, JESUS CHRIST, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, AT THE HELM- WE, ARE THE ONES, BRAVE ENOUGH, TO MAKE THIS, HUMAN WORLD: TRADITIONAL, NORMAL, PLEASING, AND BEAUTIFUL, AGAIN! MONARCHY! The answer, all along, was, MONARCHY! All other, Humans, may join me, as well :) . I will see you guys out there! My life plan, is in progress, currently. I\u2019ll be home, soon! At the, Top! I will not rush. I\u2019m taking my time. This will be my, final voyage, so it has to go perfectly, one time. Note: I, AM, the, ONLY, person, who, is meant, to marry, Men of the opposite race, and from a different, Kingdom. - Brittney Lee Hill Collier, Saturday, April the 23rd, 2021. 11:16 a.m."

2021-04-24T22:46:28Z,How did the cop pull up from in front of this man and saw the blood after
2021-04-24T22:56:36Z, Please read this carefully ;\n\nEvery one of us has sinned against God. We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .\n\nThe problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .\n\nFortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . \nRight before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..\n\nExcept gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; \n\nHumbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . \n\nDo these things, and you will be saved .\n\nIf you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  . \n\nYou\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true  .\n\nJesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;\n\n\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019."
2021-04-24T22:58:18Z,Good thing I was already on the toilet when I opened this video \ud83d\udca9
2021-04-24T22:58:43Z, Probably is goint to be an interesting movie but 01:10, 02:27 so tired of jumpscares, so predictable. 01:21 That was sick to me, anti-jumpscare effect and then 01:42, throw it all away, again"
2021-04-24T23:02:25Z, Yeah, I put your BS on pause.... People... this is what they are making you swallow, and you are lapping it up, as if  ITS JUST A MOVIE... Fodder for the damned."
2021-04-24T23:03:39Z,WWGORD... What Would Geralt Of Rivia Do
2021-04-24T23:06:22Z, i know this just a movie but i hate people blaming shit on \""the devil\""... the devil is a word for your own poor decisions/unawareness of a mental health disorder. the devil is people's own temptation to do what they know is not right deep down. humans cause pain, suffering, and plagues upon themselves by doing things that are wrong, which carry ripple effects which unfortunately affect the innocent. yet they never take accountability, because they say \""the devil made me do it\"" rather than \""I did it, and I made a mistake\"""
2021-04-24T23:06:59Z,They always know how to make bone chilling movies\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d

2021-04-25T00:36:18Z, Seems like +80% of the comments are about twerking... Oh well. If I had to say something, I'd say the trailer has notorious TWERKING."

2021-04-25T00:51:14Z,This does not capture anywhere near as close of the level of tension the 1st one caused. The 1st films trailer with the clap was enough to give anyone chills. This just seems conparable to the exorcist 3 in regards to bland sequels.
2021-04-25T00:52:57Z, The demon be like:\n\""Lorraine, LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO\"""

2021-04-25T02:53:57Z,I know this is going to be good but I feel like they are making this more non-realistic with the story and special effects added to it. The first conjuring was where it was at.

2021-04-25T15:07:02Z, What gets me is that shit like this actually happens. Possession is real. The devil is real and most especially hell. What people don't get is that that's fact. People would rather believe in alien's which I'm not saying I don't. The chances that God only created us in the multi universes is slim, rather believe half man half fish people vampire's sirens all sorts of stupid conspiracy theories and scooby doo and believe we were created by being dropped down by a stork than God, heaven angels hell demons and the devil himself. Some people don't even think there's life after death just nothing. Oh there's something alright but your actions on earth determine whether your going up or down. Over the past 10 years of my life it's been becoming appalling how many people don't believe in God the devil heaven and hell.. no one has faith. Some people say I've lost people why should I believe in him. Big deal everybody looses someone. It doesn't mean the only deity's in the world that have ever existed don't exist.  Possession has happened, is happening to people right now and will continue to happen until kingdom come and unfortunately some people don't make it. Food for thought"

2021-04-25T17:27:50Z,Would it be safe to say that every single jump scare in this preview was the scariest part and we basically seen all the horrors in this preview?
2021-04-25T17:29:52Z, What ed says there is factually incorrect. By swearing on scriptures, courts aren't implying belief in deities. They're utilizing the beliefs and by extension the consciences of people called to witness on peril of what said witnesses deem a higher authority than that of the courts themselves. It's just a clever civic and legal formality. Read a book other than the Bible and perhaps you rubes might learn something."
2021-04-25T17:33:19Z,When you involve so many people. Movie  is not horror anymore. It becomes supernatural.
2021-04-25T17:34:52Z,Name it self all Bad evil things Happening around the world because of Devil(Not by Human)\n\nLord Jesus Christ know this. Jesus will punish him and put him in Hell

2021-04-25T18:37:19Z, Take the screamers out and this movies are boring. The exorcist, for example, created something really creepy, frightening and genuine without using screamers."
2021-04-25T18:43:52Z,Curiously waiting for 3rd part of conjuring. This looks awsm .
2021-04-25T18:44:29Z,Alternate title: THE CONJURING: GANGSTA RAP MADE ME DO IT
2021-04-25T18:46:03Z,Anyone else who clicked the video and then paused it and thaught of watching it some other day instead of watching it just before u sleep? XD
2021-04-25T18:51:19Z,I wonder if the daughter shows up again as a young adult now.
2021-04-25T18:51:29Z, This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.\n1 John 4:9 \n\nMy command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.\nJohn 15:12 \n\nIf you declare with your mouth, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\nRomans 10:9"
2021-04-25T19:05:50Z, Alright yall, take responsibility for what you did. Don\u2019t just blame the big man downstairs, even he wouldn\u2019t like that"
2021-04-25T19:09:17Z,James Wan should have never left these projects

2021-04-25T19:47:19Z,Is this about the guy who killed his family in the night with an axe and said his dad's ghost made him do it?
2021-04-25T19:53:59Z, \""The Devil made me do it\""\n\nDEVIL: Why do you always blame me?"
2021-04-25T19:56:58Z,Why did you come to a 13 year olds apartment? \nEDP445: A cupcake made me do it

2021-04-25T20:05:11Z,Getting sick of these movies they never turn out to be scary. Also Ed and Lorraine were con artist always lied just watch Lorraine\u2019s interviews it\u2019s like trump at a rally always repeating herself never really answering the question and lacks the descriptive details in her stories
2021-04-25T20:07:03Z,\ud83d\udc4d
2021-04-25T20:08:09Z,Yeah I\u2019m here for this \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd

2021-04-25T20:33:04Z, I hate jumpscares as I find them boring most of the time, but in this trailer they are quite fitting."
2021-04-25T20:34:04Z, Devil : the old Valak can\u2019t come to the phone right now. Oh, she\u2019s dead"
2021-04-25T20:35:16Z,Imagine making a horror movie series so long and cheesy that it won't even scare anyone anymore.
2021-04-25T20:36:08Z,Eee ka bawasir bana diye ho
2021-04-25T20:40:16Z,In this holy Ramadan all the devils are prisoned in hell so you can't blame on them

2021-04-25T20:49:48Z, \"" The Devil mad me do it\""\nConfused Devil : Understandable have a good day!!!!"
2021-04-25T20:50:26Z,Yes\ud83d\ude2b
2021-04-25T20:52:00Z, I like how these horror movies they have someone die from the demon then don\u2019t do anything in the after life, like if I died from a demon, what makes it think I won\u2019t come back and beat its ass"
2021-04-25T20:53:09Z,If you\u2019re gonna use a water bed as something scary make sure to show the chemical burns of the water bed being more dangerous than a fake demon. My mother was abused growing up and ended up getting severe burns all over body because of water beds.
2021-04-25T21:02:56Z,It looks promising but I\u2019m nervous considering James Wan isn\u2019t the director.

2021-04-25T21:24:54Z,Gangsta music made me do it
2021-04-25T21:25:57Z,Need for them to do a movie about the Possession of Maurice Theriault. My mom use to buy produce off him when she was a kid and my grandmother worked with him in Holyoke mass for a while. My auntie Jean was there when he was \u201cin two places at once\u201d Maurice had it rough. They made a book about him called Satans Harvest. Ed and Lorraine tried so hard to help him but couldn\u2019t. Supposedly that\u2019s the exorcism that bothered her the most.
2021-04-25T21:26:11Z, Damn, it looks like it's going to rely on lazy jump scares. That's disappointing. Hopefully I'm wrong"
2021-04-25T21:26:33Z,The devil made me watch the trailer at 3 am in the night
2021-04-25T21:32:03Z,Because you failed the semester ?\nThe devil made me do it

2021-04-26T05:15:06Z,Beowulf scene with spear POPING out was nice. Maybe a laser coming out or light piecing out at you. Terminator Genius had a good sparks scene. Sure you can put together some really great scene's for the Synder Verse 3D Edition. Try to have some 3D fun. Sure it will come out great even over the top.

2021-04-26T06:35:17Z, I thought there was supposed to be a spin-off featuring The Crooked Man from the second film. Yeah, The Conjuring series features some of the best paranormal films within the possession genre, but I\u2019m a bit disappointed that my favorite demon didn\u2019t get a film of his own."

2021-04-26T07:09:20Z, Yo. What the fuck is this shit? Like seriously? If anything, you're giving Christians an accuse for how awful they act. \""Oh yes I had to hang this gay man because he was the devil\"" or even the lazily produced \""the devil made me do it\"" like seriously? Literally the only person I can think of that would find this shit even slightly scary is the autistic christian girl I work with, and quite honestly the only reason she would think so is because \""the devil\"" is in what I can assume is the title. If anything this film series is a complete farce on the horror genre. Why does religion seem to be intertwined with horror. It's like those who belive God have an obligation to belive in a devil. There must always be 2 sides of the coin for these lesser beings. \""God said this is good so it must be good, and the devil enjoys these activities so these must be awful things\"""

2021-04-26T09:07:32Z,MK was a little mild can make for the next one. When the real tournament begins. Like tournament like the first MK movie and what we wanted to see so badly in the sequel to the first MK movie. Radien needed long white hair. Maybe Shoa Kahn only cares about the tournament and respects a hell on Earth tournament. Like only thing he cares for is seeing a hell on Earth tournament like in the games. Make sure he's tall with a God like powerful voice like in MK2 the acade game and you'll make fans happy. There blueprint.

2021-04-26T10:15:50Z, Dear Warner Bros having hard time remastering Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 with current game/engine. Looks like a easy task remastering the original Mortal Kombat's one through 3 with current game. Please green light that and Mortal Kombat v Killer Instinct. Then we can get Killer Instinct characters in the third Mortal Kombat movie or know as tournament. It fit perfectly into Ed Boon cross dimensions Titan realm his in, right now."

2021-04-26T16:42:14Z, I can't wait to see this. It takes very few movies for me to go the the movie theaters these days, and I want to go so bad, but everytime I have gone to a Conjuring showing, teenagers love to laugh, excessively scream, and make jokes as their way of coping with being scared, and the whole movie is just done for me :/ I apologize for my negativity but its hard to find a good horror movie, and The Conjuring movies always deliver."

2021-04-27T17:54:37Z, So I realized these ppl were papists.  I get this comment section isn\u2019t supposed to focus on the depths of Christianity, but if any Catholics wanted to use the Warrens as evidence against Protestants to prove Catholicism is true, remember this verse.  On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers'\"" (Matthew 7:21-23).  They might have cast out demons but that does not mean that proves Catholicism right."

2021-04-27T18:21:04Z, The conjuring films SPECIFICALLY are my favorite. The cinematic universe and storytelling is fun too, but the movies based off of Ed and Lorraine\u2019s cases are my all times favs just cuz they\u2019re true stories and that makes it all the more terrifyingly fun to watch"

2021-04-28T02:22:36Z, Not really satisfied by the trailer this time. The entire Conjuring/horror series/Genre has always been about dark, there's no fun with out it.\nthe Story is quite similar to other franchises- Lorraine gets in danger, Ed arrives to rescue her and eventually both lives. PS- And same old dialogues - \""Something terrible happened here' etc"

2021-05-06T04:16:47Z,It's crazy how racist Warner Brothers have become. Firing a person because they want to hire a person with different skin color. You know that if it was a black actor that got fired so they could find a white actor that would play the part it would be all over the news there would be protests riots politics and news media would be all over it. But I guess it doesn't matter since he was a white actor that Warner Brothers fired so they can hire a black actor to play Superman. I won't be watching or supporting

This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nJohn 3:16 KJV \""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\""\n\n1 Corinthians 15:3-4 KJV \""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.\""\n\n5. Salvation is not dependent upon doing good works, religions, denominations, pastors, priests, going to church, being baptized with water, speaking in tongues, repenting of your sins, turning over a new leaf. It is dependent on putting your faith in Christ\u2019s finished work on your behalf.\n\nRomans 4:5 KJV \""But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.\""\n\nEphesians 2:8-9 KJV \""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.\""\n\nActs 16:31 KJV \""Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.\"""

Funny how if that was the other way around it would be all over the news there would be protests and riots but because it's a white guy it's okay.. be like saying we want a white black panther.

2021-05-27T07:04:35Z, \""Something terrible happened here\"" Literally every conjuring movie ever. \nThis might be a good movie but I think they are making too many movies. It was good as a standalone film. Making too many movies will just dilute the franchise. The real question is how many more are coming?"

2021-05-27T15:48:29Z, Not to ruin anyone\u2019s mood, but I have a feeling this is gonna be another basic \n C Average horror. This is NOT directed by James Wan, he\u2019s a producer instead. Do not get your hopes up and expect a Conjuring 1&2 vibe. Compare this to The Curse of La Llorona instead. Because Michael Chaves directed it, hence why you don\u2019t see the number 3 in this Conjuring. I\u2019m still gonna try this regardless."
2021-05-27T16:36:50Z,love the conjuring I've seen the conjuring one to the trailer for the third one the nun can't wait can't wait to watch the rest of the movies

2021-05-27T23:47:21Z,I wish if I could watch it in cinema but it's the rating is 15+ \ud83d\ude2d
2021-05-28T00:16:28Z, Hope the movie is better than the trailer, this trailer was awful"
2021-05-28T01:08:33Z, Given that The Conjuring movies are based on real paranormal events that demons including the Devil (fallen \ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffcs that are unimaginably evil beings who are demonic (the Devil\u2019s demons) and is diabolical (the Devil himself who\u2019s the chief demon) are behind, judging by the title this is the scariest The Conjuring movie yet! \ud83d\ude28 No surprise if any of the people in the movie are seen committing demonic actions that he/she or they get forced to commit from being possessed by the Devil. That\u2019s how he (and his demons) make people commit m*rderous crimes, by possessing them. Sounds like I\u2019m too scared to watch especially this The Conjuring movie! \ud83d\ude28 Too scary!!! \ud83d\ude28 If the The Conjuring movies  weren\u2019t based on real demon related events they wouldn\u2019t be too scary for me to watch.\n\nI actually just watched the trailer so never mind on me saying unlike the other The Conjuring movie official trailers I even feel too scared to watch this one. It\u2019s not as scary as I thought it would be for me."

2021-05-28T02:49:39Z, This one has me worried because its being directed by someone else instead of James Wan. This is why The Nun failed because that movie wasn't directed by Wan, he gets the horror."

2021-05-28T03:58:53Z,I hope Hollywood makes at least 10 of \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d movies.
2021-05-28T06:19:23Z,I watched this 3 days ago it\u2019s definitely as good as conjuring 1 it is worth the watch but not as scary as I hoped it would be \ud83d\ude27

2021-05-28T12:02:01Z,I know it sounds strange and impractical but I know one girl who used come at our place for tuition was possessed she was in her 8th grade so obviously she didn\u2019t had any mental trauma or any kind of mental diseases . $hits like this do happen.

2021-05-29T17:31:21Z,The devil made me to comment here.
2021-05-29T17:33:34Z,The main movies 1 and 2 have been great. Trailer looks great but I hope this delivers
2021-05-29T17:36:43Z, Why do people have to make bad scary movies like this about the devil? It\u2019s scary. I\u2019m a Christian an know for sure the devil is alive, but we need to not watch horror movies about him or create them! It brings him into our homes and hearts! It\u2019s not good! We all need to repent!"
2021-05-29T18:18:15Z, Okay, swearing to tell the truth, so help me God doesn\u2019t mean the Court recognizes the existence of omnipotent deities! If I were the judge, I\u2019d assume the guy has Multiple Personality Disorder and have thrown in an asylum; case closed!"

2021-05-29T22:33:08Z,Just watched this great plot plenty of jump scares just not enough gore if Iwas critical of this horror. Theres one plot twist at the end but it's a pretty obvious one tgf. 8.2/10. Another great movie from the becoming series.

2021-05-30T02:50:25Z, The movie looks good, but I genuinely hope people don\u2019t see this and think that the real killer was possessed. The guy had major mental issues to kill his entire family. There was no possession and that was a real low excuse for doing that. There\u2019s theories he didn\u2019t have mental issues at all even."

2021-05-30T16:32:05Z, I love the conjuring movies, they're always great. But I'm a little tired of them making Ed and Lorraine Warren out to be some kind of superheroes. They really were nothing more than some con artists that took advantage of everyone around them.\n\nStill excited for this though"

2021-05-31T16:33:49Z, Why does the devil always get a bad rep, just because the church said he\u2019s bad, it\u2019s god whose bad just read the freaking bible. The devil is hardly mentioned in there. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but true!"
2021-05-31T16:38:58Z, I just saw this. I would have liked it more if it has another horror icon as terrifying as, if not more than, Valak.\nWhilst the horror scenes & jumpscares are great (beautifully shot too!) I didn\u2019t really enjoy the backstory so much. It could have been more substantial, deep and terrifying in my opinion. \nBut the acting, the sets, the script, the filmography are \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc What do you guys think?"

2021-06-02T14:03:49Z, Satan..The oldest Psy-Op the Elite have used for centuries to keep us from fully integrating and becoming more than mindless, fearful cattle.  Great entertainment but if you truly fear the boogeyman, it's actually you yourself you're rejecting and afraid of which is in turn the opposite of fully accepting and loving one's self.  We are both light and dark, as is God.  Integrate your shadow and set yourself free by realizing you are imperfect yet loving yourself unconditionally was the message of Christ. Behold.. The YinYang..."
2021-06-02T16:50:28Z,Devil and God don't exist. Its only in your sick minds.

2021-06-02T20:47:56Z,I've battled people who were demonic possed and its so sad because it shows how enslaved they have the sinner. this stuff is really real and yes everyone can escape these things and find salvation in Christ Yahshua Hamashiach.  The only thing that can defeat a dark super power is a light super power.. Christ loves you all repent and come to Christ.\n\nJohn 3:16
2021-06-02T20:58:21Z, Personality speaking, it appears not as scary as the first movie."

2021-06-03T05:12:21Z,Stop blaming the devil people are responsible of their own actions the devil simply punishes the evil.
2021-06-03T05:19:40Z, I have watching it. At first, I thought #Conjuring3 movie transition wasn't interesting \u2018cause James Wan only as a producer, we\u2019re already know he usually use one shot technique transition & right now Michael Chaves proves me that I was wrong. The technique transitions were beyond my expectations!"
2021-06-03T08:01:29Z,Except Conjuring 1\nEvery part is nothing but an EXAGGERATION at its best.

2021-06-03T10:59:02Z,Have to say this was one of the more disappointing ones in the trilogy. But it was still worth watching and had some scary moments. I give it a solid 3/5.
2021-06-03T12:51:52Z,Although I\u2019m sure this wasn\u2019t real this looks beautifully shot
2021-06-03T13:37:58Z,I think I hurt someone
2021-06-03T14:20:59Z, I watched it yesterday, not really scary or unsettling, just a fair few jump scares, the storyline is okay but nothing special, glad I watched it on Bargain Wednesday for half price"
2021-06-03T15:15:03Z,Can't wait to see this... I love when a movie \ud83c\udfa5 base on a true story.
2021-06-03T15:16:48Z,Judge: I won't defend a murderer. \nThe Warrens: That's okay. We just want to invite you to have dinner in our house because we'd like to introduce you to our friend Annabelle.

2021-06-03T22:58:36Z, 6.5/10 disappointing !\n\nI just saw this movie.. To be honest I\u2019m kinda disappointed that it wasn\u2019t good as I thought it, was okay but not great like the pervious sequel. It doesn\u2019t have that conjuring vibe, it turns out that they changed the previous director of conjuring series from James wan to Micheal Chaves ."
2021-06-03T23:03:27Z,OMG IT COMES OUT TOMORROW I AM LEDGIT SO EXCITED

2021-06-04T06:10:39Z,Is it only me who thinks this trailer was not scary unlike other conjuring movies.
2021-06-04T06:27:05Z, You may think your query the questioner but the reality of revelation would occur in any people...the angels would trumpet the seven headed dragon would appear and so forth... just became questioners, you claim to believe that you are the target for all this to happen...does not mean that you are, even if there were no people I'm sure the animals would be used instead, questioners you are not on the cusp verge or dawn...no you are a meatsecal on a planet where you have no reason fabric... just your mind and it's insanity as I will direct"
2021-06-04T06:38:39Z,Is it rated R
2021-06-04T07:27:20Z, I just saw this in Dubai, as a fan i didn't like it as much as i expected, as we all know what is the hype for these movies, there are multiple jump scares which is ok because loud noise and sudden reaction scare anyone it doesn't have to be horror - but a horror movie should be like even after watching i should get scared to go to restroom or sleep alone - but i didn't feel like it. it was a good movie one time watchable acting is great, cinematography, set everything is good but it would have been more scarier than the other two, 7/10 imo. What you guys think ?"
2021-06-04T07:40:37Z,Nowhere near as good as the previous 2. I wanted to be scared shitless and left the cinema disappointed. Overall it's still a decent movie though.
2021-06-04T07:58:35Z,where them bois @?
2021-06-04T08:37:39Z,Whatt??

2021-06-04T14:59:51Z,There is a 1983 tv movie about the case. It\u2019s dated but wasn\u2019t bad. Kevin Bacon was the young man who was on trial. It\u2019s on youtube now free. It\u2019s called the demon murder case. Go back and check it out. Andy Griffith was the Ed Warren character. All the names were changed but for a tv movie made in 1983 it was ok.
2021-06-04T15:05:46Z,BLAZENDARY was great in this movie just watched it
2021-06-04T15:19:22Z, The movie was fair and good, as we watched it in cinemas. But the actors strong acting delivered it well. However this  story is refreshing and new timeline. But i still prefer the past 2 conjurings as James Wan directed it and knows how to drive people on edge. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc"

2021-06-04T17:53:50Z,It's gonna be epic\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude03
2021-06-04T17:58:24Z,I got to say this Conjuring went way off base and honestly it was a horrible movie very disappointed
2021-06-04T18:02:10Z, truth is, the kid killed his landlord and used a stupid stupid defense in court that got him convicted.\nyou got a book and a movie out of it, so kuddos."
2021-06-04T18:02:56Z,Conjuring: The Devil made me do it\nHajime Isayama: Eren made me do it
2021-06-04T18:20:27Z,It is better.. \nNot a too much horrifying scenes in it... \nBut nice acting with with a good Actors Average storyline...\nDefinately worthwatching\nI give 75%
2021-06-04T18:31:28Z,Will it's releasing in Hindi language?
2021-06-04T18:35:46Z, The ONLY movie series I\u2019ll accept for similar sagas like Fast & Furious lol,Wrong Dead franchise has completely left a bitter taste in my mouth but this movie should add the flavor back \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e"
2021-06-04T19:04:40Z, Looks great! They should do a \u2018Crooked man\u2019 movie. \n\nEdit: Watch this last night, most disappointing film of the year by far!! You can tell it isn\u2019t the same director, not half as good. Personally thought it felt like a cheap knock off version of what it could have been by the original director, waste of time."
2021-06-04T19:25:49Z,Is this Pic out yet?
2021-06-04T19:27:05Z,I thought that THIS Conjuring would have discussed the Amityville case. For some reason that\u2019s the vibe I got and what I was hoping/waiting for.
2021-06-04T19:45:48Z,Shout out to The Conjuring:
2021-06-04T19:49:41Z,Well I just finished the movie...in my opinion it was great...the conjuring directors did an amazing job they never disappoint...the backstory could have been stronger..deeper... scarier BUT it was good worth the watch.
2021-06-04T19:51:33Z,Not worth the wait. A total boring let down. What a shame.
2021-06-04T19:55:32Z,Just came from The Watcher :D
2021-06-04T20:05:25Z,How come every case is Ed and Lorraines worst one \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02
2021-06-04T20:34:19Z,John Noble is perfect for this
2021-06-04T20:40:20Z,TBH ive always been  scared when ive seen a conjuring movie trailer but this one didint seem as scary as the others
2021-06-04T21:00:56Z,Oh look.  Another movie glorifying what World Nation leaders and Hollywood do.
2021-06-04T21:02:22Z, \""The devil made me do it\""\n\n\nDEVIL: \""i am so so sorry for what i accidentally did, please forgive me\"""
2021-06-04T21:38:02Z,There's an 1983 tv movie with Kevin bacon playing arnie called the demon murder case. So technically this is a remake.
2021-06-04T21:42:09Z,I just watched it and it wasn't scary at all and I got bored near the end of the movie the previous movies were great and kept me entertained but this one wasn't as good to me
2021-06-04T21:42:56Z, The devil made me do it\nDevil: \""offended\"" how dare you"
2021-06-04T21:44:01Z,I streamed this last night! OMG! It was so freaking scary! I was like terrified to go to sleep and every noise I heard was scary.  Only watch of you want to be scared to death!
2021-06-04T21:46:55Z,In the past they would get either exorcised or put into mental hospitals.\nToday they are sitting in high positions and controlling the world.
2021-06-04T22:14:07Z,the movie was so good
2021-06-04T22:32:15Z,You can definitely tell James Wan didn't direct this.
2021-06-04T22:36:40Z, The devil made me watch it.\n\nThe first two Conjuring films are still better, James Wan is a master at it. For this film, he only produced and somebody else directed it.\n\nHowever, this movie still had me at the edge of my seat and it was still fun to watch! \ud83d\udc79"
2021-06-04T22:44:09Z,When you eat a subway sandwich with only onions on it\n\n\u201cThe devil made me do it\u201d
2021-06-04T22:46:39Z, Today is the day, enjoy everyone!"
2021-06-04T23:11:12Z,the conjuring 2 is much scariest
2021-06-04T23:42:44Z,Saw it in theaters it was solid 8/10 a bit boring at some parts
2021-06-05T00:03:35Z, Okay, this movie, is super good, but I like number 1-2 better. But still super good!"
2021-06-05T00:25:30Z,I just finished watching it and is Amazing it might knock the Conjuring 1 from the best movie in the Conjuring universe yeah the good
2021-06-05T00:26:19Z, Gods, devils, makes a good story. Only sad when people run there lives by it and think it's real!"
2021-06-05T00:52:04Z,They have made a single decent movie
2021-06-05T00:58:24Z,His eyes are blurred and foggy in the movie but not the trailer

2021-06-05T02:08:44Z,Decent movie but compared to the other conjuring films this one is the WORST
2021-06-05T02:34:03Z,based on a true story \ud83d\ude13 nice
2021-06-05T02:38:52Z,Devil watching this:dude this was me 39 years ago I was a baby...
2021-06-05T02:40:05Z,EXCELLENT MOVIE \nOpening Scene was awesome and the Terror didn't stop !!! \nKeep these movies coming I love Lorraine and Ed !!
2021-06-05T02:47:40Z,This film is veryyyyy amazingggggg
2021-06-05T02:59:57Z,Just saw this movie and I\u2019m still trying to figure out who the women was and why was she targeting the people she did? Why did she curse them for? Just cause or because there was something else more to the story. I still think Host was a greater horror movie. If you haven\u2019t seen Host then go watch it. It\u2019s perfect
2021-06-05T03:14:16Z, It felt more like an Ed and Lorraine's love story, it wasn't that scary but I really appreciate the beautiful relationship between these two ."
2021-06-05T03:21:58Z,The minecraft movie was better
2021-06-05T03:21:58Z,I DID NOT EXPECT TO SAY THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW LOW MY EXPECTATIONS WERE\nBUT THIS MOVIE GETS MOVIE OF THE YEAR SO FAR
2021-06-05T03:25:49Z, SPOILERS:\nTHE TRAILER HAS SOMETHING REALLY ALMOST INSULTING BECAUSE THEY DO : \""BASED ON A TRUE STORY\"" THEN HAVE THAT HAND GRAB THE LADY OFF THE CLIFF- NO.  NO.\nIF THIS WERE AN ICE SKATING COMPETITION THAT WAS THE 'SLIP' BUT THEN THERE'S A PART WHERE THE DUDE IS IN THE MORGUE AND THEN SOME DEAD DUDE IS STANDING THERE- PPL IN THE THEATER WERE LITERALLY LAUGHING OUT LOUD AT HOW DUMB THAT WAS\nAND THEN IN THE HOUSE APPEARS AGAIN- THAT WAS 'THE HAND PART' X5 TWO TIMES SO THAT'D BE SKATER FALLS ON BUTT, GETS UP, THEN FALLS ON FACE\nBUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS VERY INTERESTING THROUGHOUT IM GUNNA GO WITH AN 8.5/10; WOULDVE BEEN A 9/10 IF NOT FOR THOSE 3 MOMENTS"
2021-06-05T03:29:54Z,I\u2019m the type of person to look at the trailer after watching the movie
2021-06-05T04:20:40Z, For the people that still didn't watch, this movie almost gave me a heart attack the first Conjuring movie to do so, i reco watching It's AMAZING"
2021-06-05T04:22:06Z, The movie was actually not as bad as I thought, I would give it a 8/10"
2021-06-05T04:23:19Z,I just saw this yesterday and I gotta say I never been more scared in life \ud83e\udd23
2021-06-05T04:26:32Z,Loved this movie!
2021-06-05T04:36:44Z, Love how all these conjuring movies start off with \""based on a true story\""... perhaps actual events occurring in delusional minds but nothing true or fact based about about it. Great stories none-the-less. Love the movies/fiction."
2021-06-05T04:46:05Z,The devil is NOT God's equal. I never understood why people think this way.
2021-06-05T04:52:05Z,Billy just use your super powers
2021-06-05T05:02:24Z, Just watched it .... GOTTA SAY IT'S THE BEST ONE EVER IN THE CONJURING UNIVERSE ... IT'S DIFFERRENT FROM 1 & 2 ... OFC,U GYS MUST BE MAD BECAUSE IT GOT NO CONNECTIONS WITH THE CONJURING 1&2 OR THE NUN,ANNABELLE ETC . BUT THIS IS ONE IS SOMETHING ELSE .. SOMETHING MORE SINISTER AND DANGER ... I LUV IT !!!!!!!! 9/10 \u2661\u2661"
2021-06-05T05:27:15Z,1 and 2 are way better. Still a fun movie though with some boring parts. It felt more like a monster under your bed movie then a demonic one. Definitely a different vibe from the first two films
2021-06-05T05:35:13Z,May be the backstory not so Horrifying but the movie and acting is still best in this genre. Ed and lorraine still best couple till now
2021-06-05T05:51:23Z,This one is better than the second but not the first.
2021-06-05T06:16:13Z, Bruh this movie had no actual jumpscares literally, sad"
2021-06-05T06:26:59Z, Warning: possible spoiler/downer\n\nJust finished the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it. But unfortunately like any other sizzle trailer, there were quite a few things that weren't in the movie. Some of the best parts for me in the trailer were either different or not even there at all. Which, unfortunately, is a let down."
2021-06-05T06:34:23Z,2:05 i didnt see this scene in the movie
2021-06-05T06:36:04Z, I don't want to watch this movie because of the first 15 seconds of this trailer! The cop is clearly driving toward the kid and therefore should clearly be able to see the blood all over him BEFORE he parks and the kid turns around. If this isn't just terrible editing for the trailer, and the movie is actually like this, I hate it already."
2021-06-05T06:41:17Z,Fun fact the devil made me do it
2021-06-05T06:49:28Z,the conjuring universe is by far the best horror movies in the entire history... insideous would be the next
2021-06-05T07:23:40Z,This scenes weren\u2019t in the movie! 2:04 2:08 2:11
2021-06-05T07:32:34Z,it was really good! i loved ed and lorraine\u2019s relationship so much in this one

2021-06-05T08:12:51Z,This is the truth they just used Arnes story as a base and decided to make up their own story. Terrible movie
2021-06-05T08:23:45Z, Shot at 2:08, Arnie on the roof: Not in the movie\n\nShot at 2:11, Lorraine opening endless doors: Not in the movie\n\nWe got a real Rogue One situation on our hands here!"
2021-06-05T09:05:33Z,I just got done watching this movie a 9/10
2021-06-05T10:23:40Z,1:42 OKAYYYYYY
2021-06-05T10:23:56Z,Today is 4 June 2021 and I already watch it . It's a good horror movie . But I prefered 1 and 2 .

2021-06-05T13:14:50Z,This is the last film of Conjuring cinematic universe
2021-06-05T13:16:34Z,Mother -Why are you watching this horror movie\nMe - THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT
2021-06-05T13:27:23Z,Interesting movie indeed
2021-06-05T13:41:40Z,It's rare a film series as a whole never disappoints with each film.\n\nThe Conjuring is that 1 in 100 film series that always delivers
2021-06-05T13:47:23Z,Not the kind of movie that Jesus will want anyone to watch
2021-06-05T14:29:12Z,James wan should have directed this movie
2021-06-05T15:01:41Z,I wasn't that big fan of Conjuring universe until this one came. I simply love the chemistry between Ed and Lorraine in here. This is the best one!
2021-06-05T15:11:10Z,These movies are soooo over rated. Bring me a good slasher flick.
2021-06-05T15:15:15Z,2:08 was cut from the film
2021-06-05T15:18:53Z, Fact the holy water will never burn a demon nor what they r saying can bring a demon out in real life also this story never happened just imaginary but still a good one the only thing, why lying to people"
2021-06-05T15:22:56Z, The devil made me do it\nDeadpool: I did no tell him to that he got lost in translation, dopinder this is no way to treat a woman  (I'm proud of you) now drop bandhu (kill him) and then win geeta's heart back with your boish charm (kidnap her)."
2021-06-05T15:28:23Z,Super bland and derivative. The first Conjuring is the only truly good one. The second is watchable but doesn't really break new ground. This one just pretty tiresome.
2021-06-05T15:41:10Z,They can make Conjuring 10 and I will still watch it
2021-06-05T15:45:44Z,I liked it!
2021-06-05T15:49:40Z,Loved it
2021-06-05T15:50:09Z,I hope these films never end even if they have to lie and put \u201cbased on a true story\u201d after they\u2019ve ran out
2021-06-05T16:00:15Z,I recommend! Movie was good
2021-06-05T16:01:09Z,petras
2021-06-05T16:06:48Z,It was a good movie but the real scary part that kind of got to me was the credits and they played the actual recordings.
2021-06-05T16:20:30Z,Am I the only one that\u2019s been waiting to see a CONJURING title\n\nDevil made me to write this..
2021-06-05T16:45:19Z,More satanic trash to put people with fear and feed the Lucifer/Satan in this world. Isnt Enough the FAKE PANDEMIC,"Covid? WAKE THE FU.. UP, YOU LAZY PEOPLE! THIS ISNT AN JOKE. YOU ARE SUPORTING EVIL WATCHING THIS EVIL MOVIES!",
2021-06-05T17:09:26Z, Just finished watching the movie at the cinema, it was fun seru"
2021-06-05T17:43:37Z,Hollywood walo tumse horror nahi ho payega
2021-06-05T17:52:27Z, Some of the shots in this movie are very Wan-esque but definitely missed it. Like the one shot trailing scene at the kennel felt... off. \n\nNot a bad movie, I love the Conjuring series for what they are. New good horror flicks are hard to come by."
2021-06-05T18:02:43Z,Ima go see this with my sister
2021-06-05T18:08:20Z,Me : watching the movie\n\nAlso me : why is Bishop from Fringe act as a priest \ud83d\ude05
2021-06-05T18:21:13Z, I love The Conjuring 1 and 2; the fact that truly good horror is rare these days, they filled that void with James Wan being an amazing director for the genre. I was excited for The Devil Made Me Do It but didn't realize that Wan wasn't directing it. Instead the director is this guy who tainted the franchise with the terrible The Curse of La Llorona garbage and now the mainline Conjuring movies too. The 3rd Conjuring was generic and lacked the oomph Wan provided. Super disappointed and consider it an extreme let down when compared to the movies that came before it. It's just okay"
2021-06-05T18:25:23Z,Saw this yesterday and wasn\u2019t a fan. The demon was not terrifying at all and it was not scary. Wasn\u2019t bad but I was really hoping for this movie to be much more scary
2021-06-05T18:26:41Z,This was disappointing. Average . They copied scenes from the hereditary. A movie that\u2019s Actually scary.
2021-06-05T18:42:54Z,nope this one sucks too
2021-06-05T19:08:40Z,something terrible happened here....... yep... you made this movie

2021-06-05T20:10:35Z,Just about to watch this film right now
2021-06-05T20:13:43Z, Man, after Annabelle comes home, glad horror aspect is coming back. I was afraid they were heading towards a mature goosebump style of movie."
2021-06-05T20:15:32Z, just saw it last night, I was terrified throughout. I kept screaming in the theatre. loved it."
2021-06-05T20:26:09Z,I wish I could watch this in cinemas but you have to be 15
2021-06-05T20:42:28Z,Do I have to watch the previous releases before this?
2021-06-05T21:04:00Z,2:11 SPOILERS!\n\n\n\nDoes anybody know if this is a deleted scene or somth or is there a longer version of this movie?
2021-06-05T21:08:35Z,This one was the best one because it was about a witch I fw this
2021-06-05T21:11:12Z,Don\u2019t t really like scary movies but I would watch it just because of her she is a great actress\u2026I love her\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe
2021-06-05T21:14:49Z,I have always been on the edge of my seat while watching the Conjuring Movies. I  can\u2019t wait to see part 3  The Devil Made Me Do It!! I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s the best one yet and that it really delivers. We\u2019ll See
2021-06-05T21:24:10Z, Honnestly one of the last few good horror series left... \n\nWeek ago I watched \""In the Earth\""... what nonsense."
2021-06-05T21:40:49Z,Probably the best of all three Conjuring movies. \ud83d\udc4d
2021-06-05T21:50:12Z,I was actually waiting for LWYMMD song by taylor swift lol...
2021-06-05T21:54:13Z, Just seen this movie tonight, what a film!"
2021-06-05T21:55:55Z,As a fan of the conjuring films. I waited so long for the next film. Wondering if they were concerned how in the world were they going to top the past two films. I waited and waited. The conjuring the devil made me do it is the by far the biggest disappointment.
2021-06-05T22:42:30Z,Trailer just showed the whole movie
2021-06-05T22:56:34Z,I just finished it and honestly I preferred the first two movies \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it wasn\u2019t horrible. But my least favorite out of the 3
2021-06-05T23:01:23Z,i just finished watching it and army of death is more scary btw\nthe title should hav been the devil is staying out of it.
2021-06-05T23:08:41Z,director: THE DEVIL MAKE ME DO IT\ndevil  : THE DEVIL STAYING OUT OF IT
2021-06-05T23:19:23Z,Never disappointed me.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc
2021-06-05T23:44:22Z, - I did not like the movie, the director hurt the movie was complicated, it lacked more horror scenes and more action. the actors and actresses did a good job, also the work team. for the next movies to look for a new director, to make a good horror movie, you have to have a lot of horror scenes, a lot of action, suspense, deaths and little talk. short movie."

2021-06-06T00:21:53Z, Not worth watching, not even scary and boring af."
2021-06-06T00:38:19Z,Movie was so disappointing I\u2019m the scary aspect I\u2019m sad
2021-06-06T00:40:27Z,The other rando demon that no one knew made me do it
2021-06-06T00:44:38Z,To be honest this looks boring \nthe conjuring 2 when valak was first introduced i think its more scary than the others conjuring.
2021-06-06T00:53:16Z, Better then Conjuring 2 3.  Michael Chaves absolutely have talent.  Patrick wilson and Vera Farmiga great fiction couple, they playing amazing with this roles. 10/7.5  Must watch if you love Genre!"
2021-06-06T01:17:39Z,\u201cBased on a true story\u201d huh.. Lol.

2021-06-06T01:50:59Z, As a person who has watched this movie already, *this is some good and scary ish*"
2021-06-06T01:58:38Z,It\u2019s pretty scary. Lorraine really sells it. Vera is such an outstanding actress.
2021-06-06T02:25:20Z,It's a good movie.
2021-06-06T02:28:56Z, The movie is disappointing, unfortunately, not as strong as the first and second parts.  It is inconceivable that a sorceress casts spells on people without a connection between them... I did not understand what the relationship between Jessica and David to cast spells on them... and it is unbelievable that a priest raised his daughter as a sorceress and did not resist her... The film is very disappointing and  It's not strong.. simple horror... I'm so sad about this part\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude14"

2021-06-06T03:43:21Z, To all those wondering, yes, yes, yes they absolutely got this 3rd Official Conjuring installment perfect! Personally I'd have loved another hour of running time lol, but I thought it was one of the best films released this year, without a doubt. If you liked the other Conjuring movies, then you will loveee this one. If you're watching via HBO max at home, or Afdah.info online for free, make sure to watch it at night, unless you're in the theater. There's a terrifying cameo by Saddam Hussein though..."

2021-06-06T04:42:53Z,1-10 I give it a 6 but it\u2019s definitely worth watching  just not the best one.
2021-06-06T05:18:02Z,JUST WATCHED IT AND IT WAS AMAZING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2021-06-06T05:21:20Z,Warner brothers next make nightmare on elm street but your more focus on the conjuring universe that\u2019s why nightmare on elm street Reboot is still in early stages of development.
2021-06-06T05:49:28Z, the Warrens \u201cconcocted a phony story about demons in an attempt to get rich and famous at our expense,\u201d and they \u201ctold my family numerous times that we would be millionaires and the book would help get my sister\u2019s boyfriend, Arne, out of jail. I knew from day one it was a lie, but as a child, there was nothing I could really do about it.\n\n-Carl Glatzel Jr."

2021-06-06T06:07:29Z,2:32
2021-06-06T06:12:00Z, saw the movie and in my opinion, I think they should've waited for James Wan to direct it"
2021-06-06T06:25:32Z, 0:08\n\nI legit thought the cop's gonna give him a ticket for not wearing a face mask, I forgot this was in 1970's whatsoever lol"
2021-06-06T06:41:56Z, this movie wasn\u2019t scary at all. it relied too heavily of the preexisting fear of \u201cthe devil\u201d and i for one, don\u2019t believe in god nor the devil. the premise is interesting, but laughable if you\u2019re not religious. there were too many cheap attempts at horror (eg the jumpscares) and i found myself beyond bored, the climax was lacklustre and a tad bit confusing. i wouldn\u2019t recommend the movie to anyone ://"
2021-06-06T07:15:52Z,Buena pelicula.\nGood movie.
2021-06-06T07:15:58Z,But you guys can't beat Indian cinema ghost movies \ud83d\ude06 it will be horror like a small child even can see it without being scared. \ud83d\ude02

2021-06-06T11:52:52Z, This movie was a huge disappointment, from the weak storyline to the boring characters. Worst one yet"

2021-06-06T12:03:51Z, I saw the movie and i don't know why but the end when david was floating in the air, gave me chills and goosebumps, was it only me or someone else toooo"
2021-06-06T12:38:37Z, I was a little hesitant to watch since Wan wasn't directing, but I still enjoyed it. Great movie! Love the Conjuring series."
2021-06-06T12:59:55Z,This movie wasn't scary at all and very predictable. Disappointing and The Original Conjuring was the best in my opinion.
2021-06-06T13:19:37Z,Those who want the movie DM me
2021-06-06T13:34:06Z, Hate that when I watched the movie i was constantly saying \""oh I saw this part in the trailer\"". Like I completely understand you have to make the trailer exciting and enticing to viewers but it seems like they put all of the best scares and moments into this and it sucked the fun out of it for me. Otherwise, movie was amazing, some parts the CGI and such didn't do it for me but I felt like it had a good story backing it, if not entirely accurate and lacking in some good horror movie elements. If I was to rate it, solid 7/10. Conjuring 2 will probably always be my favorite, and The Nun is the worst out of the whole Conjuringverse. <3"
2021-06-06T13:38:03Z,too bad they release this during lockdown around the world. this movie deserve a box office so it can continue. I love The Conjuring cinematic universe with Ed and Lorraine Warren paranormal history.
2021-06-06T13:45:21Z, Saw it, it's more of a mystery/detective movie."

2021-06-06T16:02:14Z, I've seen it yesterday. This movie is good, but not great. Because when I watch it, I just forget the first and two. One and two is better, of course. People just feel disappointed because it's not a haunted house story, it's a witch fight. I think sometimes it's good just get the Warrens out of that for a while and do something like this. Fighting evil people, not ghost. I'm just sayin'."
2021-06-06T16:19:37Z,Saw this the other day and let me just say that I was a bit dissapointed...
2021-06-06T16:23:13Z,I\u2019ll say this is a pretty okay movie

2021-06-06T18:09:15Z,Stop making the Warren family the main protagonist and your horror trailers are starting to look more like a blockbuster action film with its numerous cliffhangers. Literally.
2021-06-06T18:16:04Z, THIS MOVIE CLAIMS: that it knows who the devil is..... it should know it was a rebound, a rebound of light and the moon and thats how people like this get made.... jack the ripper, the texas chainsaw massacre. its a rebound of light and its CUZ OFTHE CHINESE. AND THATS CUZ OF THE 2 BOMBS AND THEY LANDED THOSE BPMBS CUZ ALL CHINESES WERE LIKE THAT BEFORE. there it is"

2021-06-06T20:36:54Z,Damn seems like a good movie tho...
2021-06-06T20:56:24Z, It's still good, this is the fast and the furious of the horror genre"

2021-06-07T01:05:33Z, i recommend you watch this movie, it\u2019s amazing <3"
2021-06-07T01:26:35Z, But you gotta admit the ghosts and demons have amusing ways to toy with the people. They literally be brainstorming on how to give them a scare. Hey larry you wanna try a water bed scene, could be fun."
2021-06-07T01:29:28Z,movie was a joke
2021-06-07T01:50:59Z, Love the franchise or not, don't you think saying they're \""true horror\"" and having the film rated R for terror is a bit too smug? There are PG-13 movies scarier than the entire Conjuring Cinematic Universe."
2021-06-07T02:11:43Z,good movie based on a true story don\u2019t believe it an if it was u know they spice it up 10 times more than what really happened finna watch it doe better be good movie
2021-06-07T02:12:04Z, I heard a lot people saying this is not as good as the first two because the director changed. Don't get fooled, people. This movie is good, and the direction is *chef's kiss.* Haven't seen such a beautifully shot and edited movie in a long while."
2021-06-07T02:15:58Z,Terrible movie! It\u2019s so far away from what they achieved on the first one. Hopefully it\u2019s the last one
2021-06-07T02:31:58Z,Well to me it is a hard decision but my mind tells me that conjuring devil made me do it shows alot of what Arne Johnson went through and had a hard time and shows more actual events that had happened and my mind tells me that is a very scary when Lorraine Warren had figure out the case with Ed Warren there to see everything that happened.
2021-06-07T02:59:12Z,Same dialogue - something terrible happens here and Ed Warren says Lorraine it\u2019s time for you to come back
2021-06-07T03:47:43Z,This movie was garbage

2021-06-07T04:55:22Z, \""why did you spiked it?\""    \nhinata: Kageyama made me do it"
2021-06-07T05:12:00Z, From that time Jesus began to preach, \""REPENT, FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND\"" Matthew 4:17\n\nJesus answered. \""I AM the way.

2021-06-07T08:04:23Z, As much as I LOVE Conjuring universe, the absence of James wan really shows in this movie. The Conjuring 2 had set expectations wayyy above and this didn't keep up to its standards. It's decent for a normal horror movie but as a part of Conjuring universe, after so many great movies like Anabelle, this movie is a total let down. Waited 5 years for this sequel and it wasn't worth it at all. \ud83d\ude2c"

2021-06-07T09:31:48Z,Mmm...is valak the nun there in this movie
2021-06-07T09:54:15Z, i watched 2 shows back to back today, its an absolute masterpiece,the best thing about this part is that it even make edd and laorraine confused what that thing is,its not just the exorcism is done and the demon is finished, and thats where the movie gets more interesting that black magic is also the reason for demonic summoning to human body"
2021-06-07T10:10:13Z, Wait, I had never thought it would be possible to use the arguments of demons in court \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nI mean, if people can use the insanity plea, might as well step in with, \""I am possessed.\"""
2021-06-07T10:16:15Z,I have heard about this case the devil made me do it but i hope this movie would turn out to be the best one.

2021-06-07T12:42:40Z,The movie was awful cruella was more scary than this movie
2021-06-07T13:10:15Z,Okay so I watched the movie and I am here to leave a review first of all I didn't found this movie scary or horror that much comparing to other Conjuring movies  but this movie spoke a lot about logics and facts which the other movies never did..In the other movies it was like some sorta creepy house but in this movie it wasn't it was more to logic and facts.. Because this movie was made recently I thought there is gonna be some modern and latest and darker touch in the movie however it didn't stand out on my expectations.. Talking about other stuffs like the chemistry of Arne and Debbie aka Ruairi and Sarah and Ed and Lorraine aka Vera and Patrick was everything in basis of chemistry I would rate it 100 but  again it was not a romantic movie ik you have to have chemistry to communicate but I expected more..All the actors performed really really well no doubt on that but tbh the storyline disappointed me :)
2021-06-07T13:12:06Z,Bro Warner bros never miss in movies\ud83d\ude2d

2021-06-07T15:43:07Z,based on a true story lol
2021-06-07T15:49:01Z, I like this of all the conjuring because of the story not just focusing on scary part but the relationship between Lorraine and Ed \""She thought our love is our weakness, but she is wrong it is our strength\"" Lorraine said something like that. This conjuring is like a tribute to their love story."
2021-06-07T15:58:22Z,2:11 that didn't made the final cut
2021-06-07T16:15:10Z,Cue the Taylor Swift 'look what you made me do' Ooooh~ look what you made me do oohhhhh~
2021-06-07T17:23:13Z,The only thing I dislike about The Conjuring universe is that they always have a happy ending haha\nThe story line seems promising but falls short halfway. Anyway it's not a bas film at all
2021-06-07T17:53:27Z,I just love the movie.. The graphics etc and story line is great.. Im screaming while watching from beginning to end..
2021-06-07T20:07:58Z,I was crazy about the conjuring but frick I nearly got possessed bruv
2021-06-07T21:19:12Z, Director: I want a zombie in the movie\nWriter: Ok, we can work something out, I mean there is a morgue scene\nDirector: I want the zombie to sing a Blondie song\nWriter: Haha, yeah no sorry, but we aren't going to have a zombie sing Blondie. That's stupid"
2021-06-07T21:31:03Z,just watched it and i must say conjuring 1 and 2 was way better than this.
2021-06-07T22:05:26Z,Uninteresting predictable schlock.

2021-06-08T11:00:38Z,I can't f**** in what just shared with mates we excited \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude01

2021-06-08T14:14:46Z,spooky man
2021-06-08T14:18:29Z,I liked the 3rd movie despite a few negative reviews.  The previous 2 movies were based on hauntings where as the 3rd was based on witchcraft and possession.
2021-06-08T14:24:41Z,Based on Split Personality!
2021-06-08T15:08:28Z,Why it so many deleted scene?

2021-06-08T16:40:44Z,Opening scene was SO GOOD. I enjoyed watching the movie..  I just hated the cringy gf :/
2021-06-08T18:21:24Z,it was ight tbh
2021-06-08T19:02:49Z, Fun fact: After an entity enters ur body and has tortured u long enough, It will tell u to do bad things all the way until It tells u to commit suicide. Thats why u dont talk to spirits. Because they wont Just go away u guys Just had a paranormal fun chat. Their goanna take over ur body and It will keep torturing u until It finally finds Its next victim."

2021-06-08T21:27:16Z,Pathetic somewhere down the line conjuring series lost it.
2021-06-08T22:40:32Z, I love that the biggest serial franchises right now are superheroes, car racing thieves, and two hucksters who pretended to see ghosts."
2021-06-08T22:56:52Z, Seen this movie tonight in the cinema, bad idea"
2021-06-08T22:58:53Z, This is a romantic movie, I thaught I was gonna know more about Nun"
2021-06-08T23:24:39Z,These movies are more made up than my social life

2021-06-09T01:53:05Z,Is This Fan made?
2021-06-09T02:07:02Z,The scary part about all the conjuring movies... including Annabelle...... Every single movie is based on REAL CASES that Ed and Lorraine ventured on. The Nun is real.. \u201cThe Borley Nun\u201d.
2021-06-09T02:12:37Z,Ed: *sees wife near cliff*\nAlso Ed: *waits for her to get dragged off to run to her*
2021-06-09T02:53:25Z, Not so scary compared to the Nun.\nBut it was a good movie with a great script and actors especially Vera Farmega, she played it well like the last time"
2021-06-09T04:08:33Z,Excellent movie. It\u2019s strange that I describe a horror film as beautiful \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f..\ud83e\udd23 but it\u2019s a classic horror film with a story of love. I\u2019d say the ending credits truly freaked me out more than the actual film. Great movie overall \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff
2021-06-09T04:37:09Z,Netflix wins. There\u2019s no reason to go to the theater anymore but to spend extra cash for no twist and waste of sweat
2021-06-09T05:01:17Z,This is the most shitties movie I ever seen \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f

2021-06-09T13:07:13Z,Saw it. Blown away. Return to form. Conjurverse remains the church of horror. Chaves restored my faith in him and more. I didn\u2019t like The Curse Of La Larona or The Nun.
2021-06-09T14:11:29Z,THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE I SEEN IN SO LONG MAKE THE NEXT CONJURING ALREADY !!!!
2021-06-09T14:35:28Z,ed and lorraine always made me feel safe idk why but yes.

2021-06-09T18:49:47Z, Honestly the movie was trash it wasn\u2019t as good as the others were it\u2019s like the directors got lazy and just threw scenes together, like where the jump scare, where\u2019s the thrill, the suspense, I rate this film 3/10 would not recommend"
2021-06-09T19:10:08Z, 2025 -\nThe Conjuring : The Devil Tests Positive\n2026 -\nAnnabelle : Stay Home,Stay Safe\n2027 -\nThe NUN : Black Fungus\n2028 -\nThe Covid Curse Of Li Liorona"
2021-06-09T19:11:49Z,Who made this into a horror? It seems like a procedural with a few jump scares thrown in to make it edgy.
2021-06-09T20:22:43Z, I watched this movie since last night and the word \u201ci think i hurt someone\u201d it make me obsess and this movie is really good, i was scared a lot"
2021-06-09T21:55:49Z,When he pulled the kid out of the bed I jumped and hit my head on the chair I\u2019m crying now
2021-06-09T22:15:18Z, In generale l\u2019ho trovato molto pi\u00f9 satanico anche grazie alla storia nettamente diversa dai primi due the conjuring, senza la solita casa e la solita famiglia presa di mira. Tra un stile demoniaco e satanico, c\u2019\u00e8 molta violenza e potenza nelle scene horror specialmente inizio e fine, secondo me girate impeccabilmente. Nelle altre scene il livello di tensione non \u00e8 cos\u00ec poi tanto alto ma le ho trovate ben costruite anche se gli jump scare non spaventano poi cos\u00ec tanto.\n\nLa storia assume a tratti anche un senso investigativo data la complessit\u00e0 del enigma da scovare che coinvolge una cerchia ampia di persone. La trama infatti per questo \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 dinamica grazie all\u2019intervallarsi tra scene calme, di mistero, horror, jumps scare, tutte amalgamate in modo che ho trovato ben organizzato e chiaro\n\nTrama e narrazione le ho trovate ben curate, tutti i cerchi si chiudono anche se la storia \u00e8 abbastanza complessa, le scene hanno un perfetto senso e non rimangono buchi o dubbi perch\u00e9 viene spiegato tutto.\nLa sceneggiatura anche questa l\u2019ho trovata su un buon livello, non ottimo perch\u00e9 ci sono 2 3 sbavature, tutto sommato trascurabili \n\nPersonalmente trovo la regia di chaves molto curata e fresca: sa dare molta variet\u00e0 alle scene e molto movimento alla ripresa quando serve. Inoltre usa tutti gli elementi horror che esistono tra luci, ombre, riflessi, visioni mentali, distorsioni della realt\u00e0 dei personaggi e soprattutto la fotografia molto intonata con l\u2019ambiente e suggestiva grazie alla palette mantenuta in tutto il film.\n\nTutto sommato non spaventa come gli altri due the conjuring ma recupera questa mancanza con la violenza e la suggestivit\u00e0 di certe scene bene architettate che io ho adorato. Da appassionato horror e fan di questa saga, a me \u00e8 piaciuto molto, merita molto e lo metto al pari degli altri due"
2021-06-09T22:20:05Z,I just watched this in Cinema. 5 stars! The storyline is amazing
2021-06-09T22:47:47Z,I was pretty disappointed in this move I love the conjuring but this one wasn\u2019t scary at all
2021-06-09T23:24:14Z,The actors do a good job I\u2019ll say that to bad there in scary franchise that\u2019s full of it.
2021-06-10T01:44:24Z,Need to see it... right now!!!

2021-06-11T11:22:19Z, My 15 y.o son just said the girl he likes wants to go see this movie. (He would be going with her, his buddy, and her friend) He does believe in the spiritual world and movies like these make his spirit uncomfortable. I do feel it\u2019s like opening doors. Anyway he feels torn between having FOMO and doing what he feels is right in his convictions."
2021-06-11T11:47:44Z, Just watched this movie today and I found it more funny than scary. The jump scares were obvious and the plot was basic and predictable. This movie is nothing like part 1 and 2, which was far better than this movie. This is just my opinion, but I would rate it 5/10 overall."
2021-06-11T14:15:02Z,LINK?
2021-06-11T14:44:48Z,They've made a lot of movies based on the lies of two con artists.

2021-06-12T03:47:59Z, The story kind of derailed a bit but the acting and characters were all amazing. The cinematography is very good, the scares and thrills keeps the momentum going. Entertaining thru out."

2021-06-12T04:49:18Z, With so many evil things they have locked in that room, I\u2019m hoping with get a movie for every piece\u2026they don\u2019t disappoint. The actors for Lorraine and Ed \ud83d\ude18 are picked to perfection."
2021-06-12T05:16:27Z, just finished watching, this movie better f*cking be worth it"
2021-06-12T05:57:04Z, This movie doesn't look scary, more like a comedy with jump scares."
2021-06-12T06:18:50Z,I won\u2019t ever see this movie the same because it reminds me of the Abby Lee Miller meme \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffd

2021-06-12T12:23:47Z,I just saw the movie yesterday and it wasn't as scary as I expected it to be but I did twitch a few times at the jump scares
2021-06-12T12:23:55Z, \""The Devil made me do it\""\n\nThe Devil: I have never made anyone do anything \ud83d\udc7f"
2021-06-12T13:56:03Z,The devil made me watch this trailer.
2021-06-12T14:55:21Z,02:03
2021-06-12T15:21:56Z,until I jumped up when I watched the trailer how this hand jumped out of the waterbed ... and my wife just looked at me and tapped her forehead \ud83e\udd23

2021-06-12T22:39:01Z, Idk why but the way the guy says \""i think i hurt someone\"" sounds really satisfying to me. The shaky voice makes the line so much better"
2021-06-12T23:10:36Z,People really be complaining on how they didnt got scared or says that conjuring universe movies disappoints them Tip if u want full experience just watch those movies on 3am alone at the dark dont care if ur brave its just the best time \ud83d\ude02

2021-06-13T19:31:09Z,These movies have demons attached to them please be careful on what you watch bc they may seem like just movies but that\u2019s what the devil wants you to think so you can obliviously let demons in
2021-06-13T20:05:54Z,Looks trash
2021-06-13T20:25:37Z,Conjuring 1 & 2 seems better than this ... i expect the best in conjuring 3 !! disappointment \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11

2021-06-14T07:55:17Z, Job 12:10\r\nKing James Version\r\n10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.\r\n\r\nJob 7:9-10\r\nKing James Version\r\n9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.\r\n\r\n10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.\r\n\r\nRevelation 6:9-11\r\nKing James Version\r\n9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:\r\n\r\n10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?\r\n\r\n11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nLuke 8:2\r\nKing James Version\r\n2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,\r\n\r\n\r\nMark 5:1-8\r\nKing James Version\r\n5 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.\r\n\r\n2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,\r\n\r\n3 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:\r\n\r\n4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.\r\n\r\n5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.\r\n\r\n6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,\r\n\r\n7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.\r\n\r\n8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit."

2021-06-14T12:53:13Z, They should have told us more about the reason she cursed this people. Her father said \""you should be careful how your obsessions pass to your children\"" but he was a priest so that doesn't makes sense"

2021-06-16T06:40:56Z, For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Ephesians 6:12"
2021-06-16T09:50:34Z,I could find some deleted scenes in this trailer.
2021-06-16T12:52:58Z, I don't get why they portray these things and devil and demons as all crazy powerful wicked and sinister. But they kinda don't do much, do they? Their master plan is scaring a child with a jumpscare? Really... That's it.... Wtf, atleast let them make all the babies in a massive city be borned deformed with ability to talk backwards in demon tongue, struggling to breathe. Let all the fluids within 10 mile radius go rotten. Give us something, wtf lol"

2021-06-17T03:03:15Z, Just watched it with my sis. This movie was amazing! Even better than quiet place 2! There was unpredictable events from start to finish, a thrilling and very diverse storyline, and horrors and effects were well done. \nRoten tomatoes and metacritic scores are trippin!!"
2021-06-17T03:17:37Z,The forest scene was AWESOME! BEAUTIFUL ACTING!
2021-06-17T04:21:21Z,Hey this looks \ud83d\udd25

2021-06-17T17:58:22Z,fun fact a lot of horror movies are real but they don't say it is so they don't scare you too much :) have fun
2021-06-17T21:16:17Z,Vera Farmiga has the most mystical eyes.
2021-06-17T23:13:22Z,Best movie in the conjuring universe by a mile! So so soooo intense and was on the edge of my seat during the whole movie!
2021-06-18T00:31:34Z, For me, the trailer was actually much more scary than the movie \ud83d\ude02"
2021-06-18T01:12:09Z,To much jump scare \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f

2021-06-18T03:50:47Z,LORRAINE ALWAYS POPS OFF IN EVERY MOVIE (her actor <3)
2021-06-18T05:15:15Z,**Lucifer Samael Morningstar wants to know your location**

2021-06-18T13:22:23Z, Hopefully it would be as scary and interesting as the conjuring 2, i have never ever watched  scary n thrilling Movie like Conjuring 2 in my  wholelife before,"
2021-06-18T17:50:39Z,I watched it.. Theres nothing i can say but a heart pounding scenes \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 the exorcist scene of the lil boy also was wow. From the beginning of the movie till end it is amazing. \n\nworth the  money to spend watching for.
2021-06-18T20:04:02Z,I just watched this last night. IT\u2019S AMAZING.
2021-06-18T21:05:06Z,2:07 Evrybody: AH\nMe: That was cool
2021-06-18T23:19:38Z,For me I hate to say it but for me it wasn't good the jumps scares were so predictable. I give 4/10. At the moment they have lost the touch since la larona. I want something that keeps me awake all night not this tbh. Was not worth 2 hours of my time.
2021-06-18T23:29:10Z,Devil: That is the biggest BS i ever heard!! God is my witness\nGod: i didnt see anything
2021-06-19T00:37:35Z,It's part of the Conjuring Universe...yet it's based on a true story?  We all live in the same Universe.
2021-06-19T02:08:51Z,Conjuring is the best horror movie same of insidious
2021-06-19T04:20:32Z,IM NOT OLD TO WATCH HUS-
2021-06-19T04:20:48Z,I mean this-
2021-06-19T04:32:14Z,Cmon my brother is really ganna make me watch that \ud83d\ude2d
2021-06-19T07:09:08Z,Is it out?
2021-06-19T09:06:46Z,Bro people sayin this movie is haunted \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80
2021-06-19T09:37:58Z, The movie was ok to be honest.. i loved the first and second one, those are way more better in every aspect."
2021-06-19T11:29:02Z,i jumped right to the comment section
2021-06-19T16:47:55Z,lol so stupid movie terrible
2021-06-19T18:34:21Z, Knowing that most of this was based on a true story amazes me. I love ghost hunting and all that stuff, so this movie was drawn to me I guess that\u2019s how you put it. Beautiful acting. I loved how they portrayed the characters so well. Can\u2019t wait for more creepy movies."
2021-06-19T18:35:22Z, I saw this movie. Go see \""The Possession\"" starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan on Netflix. Much better time, and it'll wash the taste of this movie out of your mouth. Guaranteed."
2021-06-19T20:13:45Z,All the Paranormal Activity movies combined are complete garbage compared to any one scene of any Conjuring!
2021-06-20T00:37:20Z,Ugh. This film was a let down. More of a mystery/ action adventure type storyline tbh
2021-06-20T01:56:28Z,I'm being forced to go watch this today in theatres I'm scared asf
2021-06-20T02:57:19Z, Although this is not the scariest of the bunch, the thing I like most about the Conjuring movies is the performances by the cast and the relationship between Ed and Lorraine. Good movies."
2021-06-20T04:26:27Z,cap devil dont work in morning and she somehow died in morning hmmmmmmmmm
2021-06-20T05:36:55Z,Just saw this movie and the acting was amazing and the story as always was amazing 10/10
2021-06-20T08:07:30Z,So all the terrific scenes in thr trailer are not in movie ... Everything is reshooted...\nEd sweeping the alter table.. Lauren's multiple copies in gaze.. Arne on terrace with chains in neck and much much more...\nAlso I heard post credit scene is deleted....\n\nUmhhhh\nProvied movie doesn't look THE CONJURING...\nI agree the story is really nice and unique than other movies of universe.. I loved the concept of CURSE...\nBut still there is not a single scary scene (really scary) in movie... It looks like it's not from the conjuring universe... And she woman with alter is revealed in last few minutes there should have been time to develop her character like the reasons for wht she was doing tht and all and also alter was just in tht home it was also totally unsatisfactory...  It was just like ohk yes it us nkw see wht happens... Didn't rise my expectations.....\nBut I need to say that the exorcism scene and the forect scene is well done ...\nAnd the lil boy who played david was really too good at his performance..\nBut I think Arne should have given more screen time....\nAnd mr.and mrs. Ed are the bestt no doubt abt tht..\n\n\nEven if i said this much this instalment is my favv.. like due to curse story and tht alter... It's good movie but definitely it could have been much much much much more better

2021-06-20T20:23:50Z,What does this have to do with conjuring?
2021-06-20T20:59:23Z, lol I went to the movies today and the whole theatre had a power outage, I felt so bad for the people who were watching this film, because with that power outage was a loud crashing sound."
2021-06-21T00:04:45Z, This movie wasn\u2019t as scary as the rest but it was more interesting than the others, imo. I feel they could have done way better with the satanic cult angle. Having a singular person causing the trouble rather than a full cult was honestly a let down. Also the plot twist of the old dude knowing who the satanist is was not surprising. And the satanist had maybe 10 lines and :/ 7/10"
2021-06-21T06:29:02Z,I miss Valak already
2021-06-21T07:10:41Z,I\u2019m so excited for this movie
2021-06-21T11:36:23Z, Tbh, the conjuring 3 is getting better with the story but less scary than the previous ones"
2021-06-21T15:19:00Z,The part where the witches bones get broken is so creepy. and when the grandpa\u2019s neck got slit made me so sad.. and the forest scene was SOOOOO creepy yet cool.
2021-06-22T02:48:06Z, In a dark world, better not even watch these sinister movies."
2021-06-22T03:29:14Z, The scene of Arne\u2019s girlfriend asking him if he was ok and telling him to stop while he was twisting his whole body inside out was hilarious.. hello, I am possessed !!!"
2021-06-22T05:54:30Z, Watched it last night, it has its moments, but not as scary as 2. But very good nonetheless."

2021-06-22T16:00:56Z,I loved this! Wanna see it again
2021-06-22T16:15:12Z, These movies are getting worse and worse. The first one was excellent, the second, was somewhat okay, and I did not care for this one. I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s based on a true story and it\u2019s a scary thought but these movies are to Hollywood and beyond exaggerated."
2021-06-22T16:57:40Z,This trailer is very poggers
2021-06-22T17:27:19Z,I like Patrick Wilson's movies.
2021-06-22T19:55:28Z,The confusing : the peer pressure made me watch it

2021-06-23T02:28:18Z, I watch this movie and it was not that scary, I just got scare once \ud83d\ude02"
2021-06-23T05:15:42Z, I just watched this film this afternoon and I`d say it didn`t let me down. The Conjuring 3 saved and continued the style of the two previous and brought us a resonbale, thrilling, and interesting story. No dull moment in this film, jump scares and terrifying music just appeared at appropriate time. I am satisfied with these (My heart actually skipped a beat when one of a  jump scares appeared but I cannot tell you this scene XD). Many feel more like a detective TV show but I do not think it is discordant or break the Conjuring Universe law. In contrast it provides us a new view of the Conjuring instead of just an exorcism story in an old house. Whatever, I do think it is an underrated film."
2021-06-23T09:16:53Z, Did anyone see it yet, how was it??"
2021-06-23T09:54:03Z,Where can we watch?

2021-06-23T16:12:22Z,Movie's story didn't stick with us much as conjuring 2 and 1.

2021-06-26T02:16:38Z, I wish trailers (for mainstream films) wouldn't show the entire movie/narrative arc. On that same note, as much as I enjoy mystery and ghosts, thanks for saving me the time I would've spent sitting through jump scares paired with frail backstory. I think we can move on now hollywood, stop milking the Warrens!"

2021-06-27T11:54:30Z,Once again Patrick and Vera were amazing in the movie
2021-06-27T20:46:06Z,Went to see this film yesterday night at the cinema. Its extremely disappointing. Not scary and I and the rest of the oeople veiwing never jamp once. Only thing good is the story. If your going for the scares.... not worth it. 1st 2 or more jumpy than this
2021-06-27T21:27:28Z,I've watched the movie and it is the worst one in the franchise it wasn't terrifying and scary it was more about more investigation whereas the first two one were terifying and scary.

2021-06-28T01:15:47Z,This movie sucked. It was so linear and pattern-like. The ending was good tho

2021-06-28T03:29:42Z,I love the Conjuring universe but not this one \ud83e\udd71
2021-06-28T05:02:29Z,without spoiling this movie if anyone has seen it is it good?
2021-06-28T13:51:27Z, The people that have there opinion of what should have been added more to this movie! Which they are valid opinions, but the fact of the matter is that the more you add to a story the believable you make. Each one of these iconic movies were written and performance of each actor and actress was on point. This may not be the end to the whole trilogy and to give to much can take away for future release's. Keep in mind that they put out The Insidious, The Conjuring, The Nun, & Annabelle."

2021-06-30T08:01:00Z,Interesting.
2021-06-30T09:35:09Z, Not impressed. It's like a TV movie version of The X-Files meets The Exorcist but with lame actors, a predictable story, and dated jump cut effects."
2021-06-30T14:07:25Z,You can watch it in my channel
2021-06-30T14:08:13Z,MOTHER!
2021-06-30T21:39:44Z,is it scary?i hope it is
2021-07-01T03:13:27Z,I hated this one worse then the first
2021-07-01T04:41:15Z, I literally watched this movie 5x, it's so amazing and there's so many jump scares. I'm a horror movie fan, the conjuring universe never disappointed me. The actors and actresses did well, I love the story. If you're a horror movie fan, don't miss this one."
2021-07-01T04:46:07Z, If you did not like this movie or you've been disappointed. Watch first the The Nun, The 3 Annabelle movies, The Conjuring 1, 2, and 3. And The Curse Of Llorona. These are based on the true stories. So, it's better to watch in chronological order to understand. In my own opinion."
2021-07-01T18:19:28Z,Remember in the early 80s when all the middle aged men were into Blondie?  Me neither.
2021-07-01T19:42:42Z,I see Weird Horror Kid With Glasses from Color Out of Space is being Weird Horror Kid With Glasses in this movie

2021-07-02T23:52:20Z,didn't enjoy this one as much as the other ones. the conjuring 2 is still the best one so far imo.
2021-07-03T06:49:56Z,I've watched them all they're not scary.  But i thought this was a good thriller.

2021-07-05T19:55:47Z,Watched the movie. It was such a great experience and worth 2 hours of my day!!
2021-07-06T07:00:38Z,Nothing scary about any release in the series. Not even the Nun movies. Personal nightmares are where the real horror is.  Hollywood can never and will never come close to producing anything as scary.
2021-07-06T07:03:20Z, This movie was good but was NOT scary at all, a lot of funny moments tho"
2021-07-06T07:56:11Z, Why are you doing on YouTube?\n\"" The devil made me do it\"""
2021-07-06T13:49:05Z,Eh it's not that scary to be honest. Not like Annabella comes home  that movie was better.
2021-07-06T14:59:08Z,Seems more like an action movie than horror. I personally like more subtle style of paranormal stuff and a lot of suspense like in the first movie.
2021-07-06T15:33:09Z,Next conjuring Dom comes uses the chain he wears to get rid of the spirits because well family

2021-07-09T19:52:11Z,This horror trilogy Is Amazing
2021-07-10T05:10:22Z,So based on the true story. From reading about the true story behind the movie. It seem to me Arne was mentally ill not possessed. The warrens\u2019 used this family for their gain. As for the movie it was ok.
2021-07-10T08:54:23Z,I liked the movie me and my siblings watched it and i was screaming and screaming

2021-07-12T16:00:44Z,Watched it today. It was amazing! I think all Warren's cases should be on The Conjuring series and then this movie serie should be end...
2021-07-12T19:34:13Z,Went to the pics last nyt to see this!! And wasn't disappointed.. Always know any film in this series is gonae have a good few jump scares and scary as f*** looking demons n other freaky stuff. Good actors and storyline as well as it being based on a true story. Can't think of any reason not to recommend.. 10/10\nWas just gonae comment (everyones a film critic nowadays eh!) but thought nah am joining the bandwagon lol.
2021-07-13T01:00:18Z,The animation was quite visible... Even the exorcism was animated\n...\ud83d\ude25
